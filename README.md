# üëΩ gnosia-customizer (WIP)

A mod based on BepinEx/Harmony that lets you put your own characters into Gnosia.

## üôá Acknowledgements

This wouldn't be possible without the work and findings of many Gnosia fans throughout the years! In particular I'd like to call out:

 * Everyone in the Gnosia Discord who worked on the [All Skills](https://discordapp.com/channels/791411929494716446/957864790896803840/1078748972652441760) mod! Especially Pressie, who provided a lot of help to me in the modding channel. üôè
 * /u/Wave-Master's very thorough [reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gnosia_/comments/1jwcesm/comment/mmoboii/), which really helped me understand some of the more confusing internal stats.
 * /u/SAllerleirauh's various posts on [game internal stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gnosia_/comments/uxrcuv/love_levels_for_characters_from_game_files/) and their [video of Danganronpa sprites in Gnosia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Av8n6nKAE), which proved to me that something like this was even possible!

## üß™ Prototype features:

The following assets can be modified: 

**Characters**
 * Sprites - Supports up to 99 sprites per character!
 * Name + some bio page info
 * Attributes - Hidden stats that affect the character's decisions
 * Ability points
 * Known skills
 * Character dialogue
 
**Other**
 * Textures - Ex. Discussion background, interface sprite sheet, etc.
 * BGM + SFX

**Not currently supported:**
 * Player dialogue
 * Love - Hidden internal stat that affects trust, currently still uses default
 * Preferred/Non-preferred places during the night phase
 * Cutscenes outside of a typical Gnosia round (Ex. special story events that happens only once)
 * Journal entries on bio page

## üêª Quick start guide using the example

1. [Install BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).
2. Run Gnosia once to create the plugins folder (It should be in your steam directory, ex. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GNOSIA\BepInEx\plugins\`).
3. Unzip `gnosia_customizer.zip` into the plugins folder. This should add two dlls into plugins/, as well as a folder called `gnosia_customizer` that will contain all of the custom assets.
4. Run the game. You can confirm if the customizer is working if Gina's sprites have been replaced with Akane from Zero Escape.

## üé® Customizations

Here's a quick guide on how to use each of the customizations that the tool can offer.

### Character sprites

There are 14 folders in the `gnosia_customizer` assets folder, each of which correspond to one character. This is the character that each folder corresponds to:

| ID | Name  |
|----|-------|
| p01  | Gina       |
| p02  | SQ         |
| p03  | Raqio      |
| p04  | Stella     |
| p05  | Shigemichi |
| p06  | Chipie     |
| p07  | Remnan     |
| p08  | Comet      |
| p09  | Yuriko     |
| p10 | Jonas      |
| p11 | Setsu      |
| p12 | Otome      |
| p13 | Sha-ming   |
| p14 | Kukrushka  |

Within each of these character folders, you'll find the character's `config.yaml` file and all of their sprites. 

Sprites must be named in the format hXX.png, where XX is a number between 00 and 99. The IDs must be zero-padded, so h1.png would not be recognized, but h01.png would be. You can add up to 99 sprites per character (i.e. h00.png up to h99.png), but note that the original game uses 8 sprites per character, and each sprite ID generally corresponds to a certain expression. 

Therefore, if you plan to use the game's existing dialogue, I'd recommend setting h00.png-h08.png to sprites with the following emotions:

| ID | Description  |
|----|-------|
| h00  | Neutral/Default |
| h01  | Relieved, as when expressing thanks for being trusted |
| h02  | Annoyed |
| h03  | Hurt, this is also used when put into cold sleep or when killed by the Gnosia |
| h04  | Surprised |
| h05  | Worried/Thinking |
| h06  | Smug |
| h07  | Gnosia, only used in certain scenes |

For instance, to overwrite Gina's sprites, you'll want to create 8 images h00.png, h00.png, h01.png, h02.png, h03.png, h04.png, h05.png, h06.png, and h07.png in `gnosia_customizer/p01/`. Below is an example showing Gina's sprites replaced by Akane from Zero Escape.

Make sure to resize the image to have a height of around 800-900 pixels, or else the character may not appear correctly on the screen!

This is after resizing the image with a height of 830px:

If you create additional sprites beyond ID 7, read on to see how to use them in dialogue.

### Character config.yaml

Each character folder also contains a file called `config.yaml`, which contains all other information about them. This is written in [YAML format](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started) and contains comments that start with a `#` character. These are ignored by the mod, but can provide context on what each of the fields means. Here is a snippet from an example config file:

```yaml
# How the game and other people will address this character.
name: Taka
# 0 = Male, 1 = Female, 2 = Non-binary.
sex: 0
# Where the character is from. Only shown on their bio page.
origin: "Dangan\nronpa"
...
```

There are [many ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/how-do-i-break-a-string-in-yaml-over-multiple-lines) to format multiline strings in YAML files, but the way I'd recommend would be to use `\n` for a new line, and use `\"` to escape the quote character if it is ever needed.

#### Stats

There are multiple kinds of character stats that influence their AI behavior in the game. Generally I'd recommend starting with a base Gnosia character as a "template" and slightly tweaking the stats to more closely represent your character, rather than coming up with these from scratch.

##### Defense/"HP"

This value is originall called "HP", but I'm borrowing [/u/Wave-Master's terminology](https://files.catbox.moe/9w2qpy.txt) and renaming this to "Defense" to be more accurate. I'd recommend reading their breakdown on how this stat works, but it roughly represents their resistance to "doubt attacks".

```
# Their base 'defense' rating against doubt.
defense_min: 110
# Their base 'defense' rating against doubt, as a Gnosia.
defense_with_gnos: 160
```

I might be incorrect about the "defense_with_gnos" representing their defense value as a Gnosia, so this might change in the future.

##### Attributes

Attributes are an internal stat that decide the actions that the character chooses to make. For instance, the player character technically has attributes, but they're all set to the default 0.5 because all of their actions are already decided by the player.

```
# Affects the character's likelihood to perform certain actions.
attributes:
  playful: 0.32
  social: 0.4
  logic: 0.6
  neat: 0.46
  desire: 0.47
  courage: 0.82
```

I'd recommend consulting the [wiki](https://gnosia.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Stats#NPC_Attributes) as a guide on what typical values look like for these stats and what they do.

##### Ability points

Ability points should be mostly intuitive because this is also a stat that the player uses in the game, but internally these are configured on a 0.0-1.0 floating point scale instead of a 0-50 integer scale. 

This is also a stat that grows with each character's progression, so you actually set the min+max values. I'd recommend checking out [this comment by /u/Wave-Master](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gnosia_/comments/1jwcesm/comment/mmoboii/) for more information on how the actual ability point stats are determined for NPCs. There's some exceptions (Yuriko), but generally half of their progression comes from unlocking all of their story notes, then the other half comes from spending time with them during the night phase and winning games with them.

```
# The character's starting ability for each type.
abilityStart:
  charisma: 0.07
  intuition: 0.08
  charm: 0.15
  logic: 0.2
  perform: 0.04
  stealth: 0.18

# The character's maximum ability for each type.
abilityMax:
  charisma: 0.35
  intuition: 0.91
  charm: 0.48
  logic: 0.63
  perform: 0.26
  stealth: 0.63
```
##### Known skills

Here you can put `true` for skills that you'd like the character to be able to use, and `false` for skills that you don't want the character to use. I know technically Retaliate is both a Logic & Performance skill, but I categorized it here as performance for organizational purposes only (doesn't affect the requirement).

```
# Skills the character is capable of using. If a skill is not present here, false is assumed.
known_skills:
  charisma_step_forward: true
  charisma_seek_agreement: false
  charisma_block_argument: false
  intuition_say_human: true
  intuition_dont_be_fooled: true
  charm_regret: false
  charm_collaborate: false
  logic_vote: false
  logic_dont_vote: true
  logic_definite_human: true
  logic_definite_enemy: true
  logic_freeze_all: false
  perform_retaliate: false
  perform_seek_help: false
  perform_exaggerate: false
  stealth_obfuscate: false
  stealth_small_talk: false
  stealth_grovel: false
```

Since not all characters have these lines by default, a placeholder line "..." will be used if a character uses a skill they currently do not have dialogue for.

### Dialogue

The config.yaml file currently supports ~200 lines of dialogue that can occur during a regular game. This should cover most of the discussion during a typical round, but will not include story cutscenes or special reserve endings (i.e. anything that happens only once). 

There are two types of dialogue: Single line and multiline. Most dialogue is single-line, so multiline dialogue is designated with a `multiline_` prefix. 

Here is an example of how single-line dialogue is formatted in `config.yaml`:

```
# Statement at the start of the round.
opening_statement:
  line: "Okay then... everyone, close your eyes!\nAnd whoever is the Gnosia, raise your hand!"
  sprite: 2

# Mourning the loss of {0} during the night phase.
opening_remarks_condolences:
  line: "I assert that the one who was murdered was {0}!"
  sprite: 18

# Celebrating that no one disappeared last night.
opening_remarks_no_deaths:
  line: "Looks like everyone's here today!\nTime to start the discussion!"
  sprite: 17
  
# Reacting to the deaths of {0} ('Name1 and Name2') during the night phase. One of them was the bug, eliminated by the Engineer.
opening_remarks_two_deaths:
  line: "Two...?!\n{0}... we won't let you down!"
  sprite: 12
```

Each line of dialogue has a unique name identifier that lets the mod know which line it corresponds to (ex. `opening_statement`, `opening_remarks_condolences`, `opening_remarks_no_deaths`, etc). Don't change this, otherwise the line won't be added to the game.

I recommend surrounding the text in double quotes as shown in the example, and inserting new lines with the `\n` character. Note that the text box can only fit three rows of text.

Some lines of dialogue can mention the name of a character, characters, or role. The comment should mention if this is the case. For example, `opening_remarks_condolences` allows you to mention the name of the person who went missing with `{0}`. In some cases this could be two or more names, such as with `opening_remarks_two_deaths`. You also do not have to include the replacement character in the dialogue.

The `sprite` field is where you can indicate which sprite ID to use with this dialogue. This corresponds with the number in the h00.png sprites in the character's folder. For instance, `sprite: 4` would use the "Surprised" pose, or whichever image you added as `h04.png`. 

If you created additional sprites beyond ID 7 (i.e. h08.png, h09.png, etc), you can use their ID here as well (ex. 8 for h08.png, 9 for h09.png, etc).

**Multiline dialogue** is generally used for nighttime conversations and ending cutscenes. The game will run through all of the lines of dialogue in sequence. 

In certain multiline dialogue sequences, the game is also capable of triggering a soundtrack change (Ex. the Gnosia theme playing when they say, "I'm Gnosia") or a sound effect (Ex. a chime when they say "{0} is lying"). In these specific sequences, you can trigger this by adding 100 to the sprite index.

Here are some examples of multiline dialogue:
```
# Ending conversation when the character wins as a human with the player. Inside trust > 0.4
multiline_end_human_win:
  lines: 
    - line: "It's o-over...?\nBut wh-what are we going to do now...?"
      sprite: 4

# Second of two ending conversations when the character and player are both Gnosia, and no Gnosia were put into cold sleep.
multiline_end_gnosia_perfect_win_together_1:
  lines: 
    - line: "Yes, now we just need to get r-rid of-"
      sprite: 6
    - line: "A-achoo!"
      sprite: 16
    - line: "Did I hear a party starting? PLEASE tell me I'm invited!"
      sprite: 22
	  
# Night conversation that the character has discovered a liar. {0} = Player name, {1} = Target name. Add 100 to the sprite index to trigger the sound effect.
multiline_night_liar_found:
  lines: 
    - line: "I c-couldn't say anything earlier..."
      sprite: 3
    - line: "{1}... they were l-lying the entire time!"
      sprite: 113
    - line: "W-Wait... If {1} finds out I told you, will I d-d-disappear?!"
      sprite: 8
    - line: "N-No! F-forget I said anything!"
      sprite: 9

# Ending conversation when the character wins as a Bug.
# Add 100 to the sprite index to trigger the music.
multiline_end_char_is_bug:
  lines: 
    - line: "To l-live is to hurt others...\nDo you b-believe that, {0}?"
      sprite: 0
    - line: "It doesn't matter what you t-think, because..."
      sprite: 1
    - line: "I'm the B-Bug.\nSoon, my existence will destroy the universe..."
      sprite: 103
    - line: "G-Goodbye..."
      sprite: 3
```

In the examples above, `multiline_night_liar_found` and `multiline_end_char_is_bug` trigger a soundtrack change or sound effect. In the 'liar found' conversation, the sprite index `113` will use sprite 13 while also playing the "liar" sound effect. In the "I'm the bug" conversation, the sprite index `103` will use sprite 3 while also starting the "Bug" music.

**Engineer/Doctor reports** are also a slightly special case, because the game combines two lines of dialogue to create these. In the config.yaml file, these are labelled as "pt1" and "pt2" to indicate which end of the report they can go on.

Basically, it can help to end the "pt1" lines with a new line character so that these look consistent. Here are some examples of report lines:

```
# As {0} ('Engineer') giving their report first, the first sentence of their report that they investigated {1}.
report_engineer_pt1:
  line: "Here's my report.\n"
  sprite: 0

#  As {0} ('Engineer'), the first sentence of their report that they investigated a different target than what the other Engineer reported.
report_engineer_pt1_different_target:
  line: "I investigated someone else.\n"
  sprite: 0

# As Engineer, the second sentence of their report that {1} was {0} (Gnosia).
report_engineer_pt2_gnosia_result:
  line: "I investigated {1}. {1} is {0}."
  sprite: 0

# As Engineer, the second sentence of their report that {1} was {0} (Human).
report_engineer_pt2_human_result:
  line: "I investigated {1}, and the result was \"human\".\nNot {0}."
  sprite: 5
```


### Audio

The `audio` folder is for custom audio in .wav format. If it matches the name of an in-game sound file, it will be substituted. You can unpack the game assets to see more, but here's a table with a quick guide for some common tracks:

| Name | Description  |
|----|-------|
| G_bgm_01_strm.wav  | Vote screen |
| G_bgm_02_strm.wav  | Default discussion music |
| G_bgm_03_strm.wav  | Discussion music when your average trust is above 75% (Ex. Labelled 'Definite Human') |
| G_bgm_04_strm.wav  | Conversation |
| G_bgm_06_strm.wav  | Small Talk |
| G_bgm_07_strm.wav  | Sad conversation |
| G_bgm_10_strm.wav  | Title |
| G_bgm_13_strm.wav  | Discussion music when your average trust has fallen below 25% (Ex. Labelled 'Definite Enemy') |
| G_bgm_15_strm.wav  | Configure loop |
| G_bgm_22_strm.wav  | Gnosia |
| G_bgm_23_strm.wav  | Happy end |
| G_bgm_24_strm.wav  | Bug victory |
| G_bgm_26_strm.wav  | Obfuscate |
| G_jin_02.wav  | No one was attacked last night |
|G_jin_03.wav| Last night, ___ disappeared |
| G_jin_06.wav |You were killed by Gnosia |
|G_se_pusyu.wav|____ was put into cold sleep|
| G_uta_02_strm.wav | Night phase music |

Ex. To replace the night phase music, save the track as G_uta_02_strm.wav in plugins/sound.

Here's an example of what the audio directory might look like if you replace a lot of tracks:

### Other textures

The `other_textures` folder is for .png files that can be swapped in place of existing textures and/or sprite sheets. This is more of a hacky solution, so there might be a better way to do this in future versions.

Images in this directory will need to be named according to the internal texture name in Config.m_texturePathMap. If an image matches the name of the texture, it will be substituted in place of the texture.

You can decompile the dll to access the full list, but here's a list of some common textures:

| Name | Description  |
|----|-------|
|title0.png - title3.png| The title screens |
| bg_mainConsole.png  | The discussion room background |
|coldSleepRoom.png| The cold sleep room background|
| interface.png  | Sprite sheet with the 'TARGET' and default mini-portraits |
| cIndex.png| Sprite sheet with character selection| 
| result.png| Sprite sheet with all possible mini portraits for the end of round screen (win, lose, bug)|
| vote.png | Sprite sheet with the voting portraits |
| data_vote.png| Sprite sheet for the voting results|
| select_tgt.png| Sprite sheet when investigating/selecting someone during the night phase |

Here's an example of what the `other_textures` directory might look like:

![Screenshot](readme_othertextures.png)
