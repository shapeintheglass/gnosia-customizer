t_keisho,,,,,
t_aisatu,0,,,Happy,I am {0}. Greetings.
t_suspect,0,,,Thinking,"What we need to do is clear: purge the {0}.
One could even say that it's my solemn duty..."
t_suspect,1,,,Happy,"You sure are being talkative, {0}
Some sort of... camouflage, perhaps?"
t_suspect,2,,,Neutral,"Blossoming into full believability...
Is {0} perhaps a flower of betrayal?"
t_suspect,3,,,Happy,"{0}. Staying quiet will only exacerbate the situation.
Nay... perhaps that's exactly what you want?"
t_suspect,4,,,Surprised,"We now must rely on logical consequence.
Yes, probability states that {0} should be target of suspicion..."
t_suspect,5,,,Thinking,"What's the matter, {0}?
Come, don't hold it all in - share with us..."
t_suspect,6,,,Annoyed,"{0}. Our alliance has fizzled to its end.
Now I am not betraying you, you see.
You... YOU betrayed JONAS!"
t_suspect,7,,,Hurt,"Last night's attack on {1}...
I hereby accuse... {0} of this heinous act of treachery!"
t_suspect_r,0,,,Happy,"Presently... from inside my guts sprouts a bud of doubt toward {0}.
I just may let it blossom into full bloom!"
t_suspect_r,1,,,Neutral,"Your silvery tongue is indeed sharp, {0}.
Perhaps even, dare I say it, super-duper sharp...?"
t_suspect_r,2,,,Hurt,"An attack on {0} would not likely be met with substantial resistance.
This... is my Rubicon.
Lo! {0}! I hereby full-on accuse thee!"
t_suspect_r,3,,,Hurt,"Persisting in silence is {0}'s way.
However... in such dire straits as these, it is simply not cool."
t_suspect_r,4,,,Thinking,"Our suspicions should be chucked toward {0}.
As much as my balls do feel kicked to say it, alas, it's true."
t_suspect_r,5,,,Happy,"Further contemplation tells me that {0} is, indeed, sketchy.
Hehe, 'tis said: ""A wise man changes his mind; a dumbass... like, doesn't."""
t_suspect_r,6,,,,...
t_suspect_r,7,,,,...
t_suspect_add,0,,,Hurt,"My sixth sense has been whispering in my ear.
""Do not trust {0},"" it warns."
t_suspect_t0,0,,,Neutral,"Maybe it's just my feelings toward {0}...?
But it's just as {1} said not a moment ago."
t_suspect_t0,1,,,Thinking,"Methinks {0} doth spout bullshit too much.
Hm, maybe it's from fear of being purged...?"
t_suspect_t0,2,,,Neutral,"I agree.
{0} is akin to a snake in one's own bosom."
t_suspect_t0,3,,,Happy,"Hiding in the shadows, waiting to pounce, are we?
Well not today, {0}. Hah! Not. To-day..."
t_suspect_t0,4,,,Happy,"Well, {0}?
Has {1}'s assessment not hit the mark right on the... mark...?"
t_suspect_t0,5,,,Hurt,"I do harbor my own doubts about {0}...
I can feel it; something squishy, in my very guts."
t_suspect_t0,6,,,Annoyed,"What say you, {0}? Does it not torment you so?
You've made an enemy of me, hence...
SUCK IT."
t_suspect_t1,0,,,Smug,"For {1}...
I shall submit my approval of a purge of the scoundrel {0}!"
t_suspect_t1,1,,,Happy,"Tis said that the tongue wounds more than a lance.
Thus I, too, shall be wary of Lance - and his tongue."
t_suspect_t1,2,,,Thinking,"{0} is our ENEMY, you say?! Well, yeah, OK, I get that..."
t_suspect_t1,3,,,Happy,"Hah! I see you waver, {0}.
Hehe, yes, and WAVER, you SHALL... or something."
t_suspect_t1,4,,,Hurt,"Mathematically speaking, {0} draws suspicion...
'Tis said the mathematics is the king of scholarship...
And the king is, like, super smart..."
t_suspect_t1,5,,,Hurt,"Oh, how I pity you, {0}.
To be doubted by someone such as me..."
t_suspected0,0,,,Happy,"As much doubt as you seem to cast upon me, I assure you...
I'm heaping it upon myself pretty hardcore, too."
t_suspected0,1,,,Happy,"Lo! What is this, now?
Hehe, I seem to have fallen out of favor."
t_hanron0,0,,,Neutral,"To believe or not to believe {0}...
Should we not choose to believe, lacking evidence otherwise?"
t_hanron0,1,,,Happy,"So {0} is suspicious, say you...
But are these words spoken by {1} in verity?
Or... like... NOT verity...?"
t_hanron1,0,,,Smug,"Lo! The gamble has begun.
To bet my chips on ""Yeah, {0} is cool""."
t_hanron_t0,0,,,Happy,"I, too, place my trust in {0}.
I mean, like, comparatively."
t_hanron_t1,0,,,Happy,"Ah! So {0} is not to be the object of our doubt, you say?
Interesting. Yeah sure, I'm down, bro."
t_trust,0,,,Smug,"{0}... My friend and companion.
Trust you, I shall. Natch."
t_trust,1,,,Hurt,"I can hear the whispers of logical conclusion...
They say, ""Yup, trust {0}."""
t_trust,2,,,Neutral,"The compass of my heart points straight to {0}.
Let us trust {0} in full!"
t_trust_r,0,,,Hurt,"Alas... {0}, I trust you.
I believe you shall lead me to the promised land..."
t_trust_r,1,,,Neutral,"And now, for a directional shift. I believe {0}.
I mean, it's like, only logical and stuff, right?"
t_trust_r,2,,,Smug,"Do your hearts not tire running the marathon that is doubt?
{0}, I quench my thirst with the electrolytes of ""trusting you""!"
t_trust_t0,0,,,Happy,"I trust {0}... I guess.
OK, fine. Yeah. Definitely."
t_trust_t1,0,,,Neutral,"I agree.
I myself am not fit to disbelieve the mouth sounds of {0}."
t_trusted0,0,,,Hurt,Lo! A comfy wind bloweth right up in my face!
t_thanron0,0,,,Happy,"Just what could lead one to trust the words of {0}?
Alas, I have no idea like, whatsoever."
t_thanron1,0,,,Thinking,"To believe {0}. A proposal too attractive to accept.
Attractive, like... um... a flower... with... Thorns! That's it!"
t_thanron_t0,0,,,Hurt,"The trusting heart is a thing of beauty...
But sometimes, it's also, like... super wrong, or something."
t_thanron_t1,0,,,Hurt,"How I wish that I, too, could trust one unconditionally.
As I did that time... You know, that one time... Uh..."
t_hosho,0,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is the true {1}."
t_hosho,1,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is human."
t_hosho_enemy,0,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is like, totally not {1}."
t_hosho_enemy,1,,,Annoyed,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is {1}!"
t_hosho_enemy,2,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is {1}. 100%."
t_hosho_enemy,3,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is nothing other than {1}."
t_hosho_enemy,4,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is a liar, liar... Pants... on fire."
t_hosho_enemy,5,,,Happy,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed...
{0} is not Gnosia, and yet, also, totally fibbing, though."
t_hosho_miss,0,,,Smug,"{0}. This proves nothing.
C'mon, try harder, buddy."
t_hosho_miss,1,,,Hurt,"Alas, {0}, as a wise man once said, ""no doy"".
Have you not something else you maybe wanna spit out?"
t_hosho_get,0,,,Neutral,"I thank you for that, {0}.
My righteousness hath doth... beenth... proventh...ed."
t_hosho_get,1,,,Annoyed,"Thus, it hath been... proventh...ed... I guess.
Hehe, nice one, {0}."
t_tohyo_go,0,,,Hurt,"This silence... It comforts me.
One last savory taste of you guys shutting up before the vote."
t_tohyo_mae,0,,,Smug,"Hark! The bells of ""time to vote, y'all"" ring loud and true!"
t_tohyo_sai,0,,,Happy,"A second vote, eh?
So like, for {0}, right?"
t_shokei,0,,,Happy,"Hehe... I'm personally quite fond of silence myself.
To sleep - perchance to dream... Hell yeah, let's do it."
t_shokei,1,,,Hurt,"And now... to dream.
A true dream, no longer tinged by lies..."
t_wakare,0,,,Thinking,"{0} - my friend...
May the bumper cars of fate let us bonk heads once again."
t_karare,0,,,Annoyed,"Aha! So you finally show yourself before me, {0}.
Now, let us play!"
t_imjinro,0,,,Gnosia,"Away withy the filthy world! We shall play in Paradise!
Hahahahaha! {0} is absolutely the scene, you guys!"
t_shori,0,,,Happy,"{0} is no more; 'tis known.
Now, my time of childlike play must also end..."
t_tohyo_kurikaeshi,0,,,Thinking,"Ah, so a decision cannot be reached...
What to do,what to do...?"
t_tohyo_jeno,0,,,Smug,"Fear not, {0}.
After you have been put to sleep, I shall take over in your stead.
Now you need only take a chilly little nap, 'kay?"
t_tohyo_alive,0,,,Neutral,Let us remain calm and await our enemy's next move.
t_tohyo_jeno_ok,0,,,Neutral,"Ah, yes.
To the ice box for all. I, too, shall place my chips on this bid."
t_tohyo_jeno_ng,0,,,Happy,"Lo! 'Tis said: Waste makes... I mean, Hasty waste is... Uh...
Let's just not do this, 'kay guys?"
t_tohyo_alive_ok,0,,,Neutral,"Ah, a vote to watch events unfold, I see?
A brave proposition indeed. I'm down."
t_tohyo_alive_ng,0,,,Thinking,"Yeah, like, no.
Not gonna do it."
t_tohyo_jeno_kettei,0,,,Smug,"{0}.
In all honestly, I envy you all.
Rest in peace."
t_tohyo_alive_kettei,0,,,Happy,"It seems calmer heads have prevailed.
Hehe, if nothing else we have bravery in spades."
t_tohyo_hitei,0,,,Annoyed,"Ah, so you dig not my modest proposal, I see?
Fine then, whatever. I'm not angry. YOU'RE angry..."
t_tohyo_dame,0,,,Hurt,"Tis time...
And now, to bravely do nothing!"
t_tohyo_dame,1,,,,...
t_co,0,,,,...
t_co,1,,,Smug,"Tis I, the {0}. Hehe, don't I look spiffy?
I shall seek out those tainted by the dread Gnosia..."
t_co,2,,,Happy,"It would seem as though the {0} is I... For some reason, I guess.
I shall check the crispy frozen ones for Gnosial infection.
Should be easy enough, right?"
t_co,3,,,Hurt,"On this ship travels a {0} sent directly from... The GOVERNMENT!
In case that wasn't clear, I'm talking about me."
t_co,4,,,Happy,"At our previous port, I remained onboard the ship.
I had, like, you know... Stuff to do.
Therefore, cast your doubt not upon me, but... other dudes!"

t_co_find,0,,,,dammy
t_co_find,1,,,Annoyed,"Hark! The {0} reports!
{1} has become one with the Gnosia!
Should you need proof, I'll totally show you my work..."
t_co_find,2,,,Hurt,"As {0}, I examined the hard, frozen guts of those in cold sleep.
An lo! {1}, who sleeps so frostily, hath tur-ned GNOSIA!"

No, for real though. I'M the {0}."
t_co_taiko,2,,,Annoyed,"{1}. If you are {0} as you claim, then what of I?
Hehe, you are aware in full, are you not?
I am JONAS! This ship's {0}, duh."
t_co_taiko,3,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,4,,,Smug,"I shall vouch for {1}.
I, too, remained onboard this ship.
Let {1} and Jonas form... an ALLIANCE!"

t_co_taiko,8,,,,dammy
t_co_req,0,,,Happy,"Hehe, calm down, and take it easy.
Lo! The time has come to announce yourself, {0}!"
t_co_after,0,,,Neutral,"So, only one claimant to the role of {0}, hm?
Let us raise a toast to the bravery of {1}!"
t_co_after,1,,,Happy,"Ah, but WAIT...!
This ship is only supposed to have ONE {0}! So, you know..."
t_co_after,2,,,Annoyed,"Hehe, look...
Tempted by the fruit called {0}, the enemy shows itself unwittingly..."
t_uranai_o,0,,,Annoyed,So our enemy is indeed among us... Sweet.
t_uranai_s,0,,,,"Allow me, as a master of my field, to REPORT!
"
t_uranai_b,0,,,,"And now, you guys... a REPORT!
"
t_uranai_t,0,,,Happy,"{1} is... Hehe, should I say it? For real?
'Tis true! {1} is a dirty, filthy, creepy {0}!"
t_uranai_f,0,,,Hurt,"{1} could not possibly be {0}. HOW-EVER...
That's, uh... actually all I got."
t_uranai_n,0,,,Hurt,My research has concluded.
t_reibai_s,0,,,,"The frozen, icy human body is a beautiful thing.
I kinda messed it up with my ""examination"", though. "
t_reibai_s,1,,,,...
t_reibai_t,0,,,Thinking,I hereby... RE-PORT! {1} {3} {0}.
t_reibai_f,0,,,Thinking,I hereby... RE-PORT! {1} {3} not {0}.
t_reibai_ft,0,,,Thinking,RE-PORT! {2} {4} {0}.
t_reibai_ff,0,,,Thinking,RE-PORT! {1} {3} not {0}.
t_houkoku_s,0,,,Hurt,"You... totally ripped off my results, didn't you...?"
t_houkoku_w,0,,,Happy,"From me, a resounding NOPE! A-HA! The fiend's facade crumbles!"
t_okuyami,0,,,Thinking,"RE-PORT! {0} has been... victimized.
Cause of death: GNOSIA!"
t_okuyami_n,0,,,Happy,"No victims recorded.
Our enemy's loss is our victory.
Hehe, sweeeet..."
t_okuyami_f,0,,,Surprised,"Two recorded victims... {0}.
One was apparently, uh... you know..."
t_houkoku_req,0,,,Smug,"Come now... Offer up your RE-PORT!
Pretty please?"
t_houkoku_not,0,,,Happy,"Lo! {0}... Have you no RE-PORT?
Or could it be that... You are somehow unable to RE-PORT?!"
t_skill_sayNingen,0,,,Hurt,"To find the truth, one must first reveal their own.
I hereby swear before you all: I am HU-MAN!"
t_skill_sayNingen,1,,,Happy,"Hm... Let it be known.
I, my own self, am, indeed... HU-MAN!"
t_skill_sayNingen,2,,,Thinking,"A declaration of humanity, you say?
This I cannot abide. Because... reasons."
t_skill_sayNingen,3,,,Annoyed,"To think that all would agree not to such a declaration...!
Well, that just sucks."
t_skill_sayNingen,4,,,Annoyed,"Wait, so... is that it?
There are those amongst us who have yet to speak up.
This is... not cool at all!"
t_skill_sayNingen,5,,,Happy,"To think that all would agree to make such a bold declaration...
I mean, yeah, great, I guess."
t_skill_sayNingen,6,,,Happy,"What's the matter, {0}? Your emotions run hot!
Are you, perhaps... ACTING?"
t_skill_zatsudan,0,,,Neutral,"You all look so weakened and weary...
Have you perchance not been taking in enough... yummies?"
t_skill_zatsudan,1,,,Hurt,"Ah yes, love...
Let us speak of that which sways our very existence!"
t_skill_zatsudan,2,,,Thinking,"Our own eradication from this universe...
There is nothing so frightful as this.
The true terror; to... be no longer..."
t_skill_zatsudan,3,,,Happy,"The discovery of new cuisine trumps that of a new star...
I mean, you can't munch on a star, so... yeah."
t_skill_zatsudan,4,,,Hurt,"Should the opportunity present itself, I, too, may fall in love.
Like, immediately..."
t_skill_zatsudan,5,,,Thinking,"In the synthetic plant lab, I laid eyes upon it...
A plant, combined with glistening, white flesh...
In shape, it was almost... human..."
t_skill_zatsudan,6,,,Happy,"Fellow crew, 'tis all well and good to get all... friendly-like.
But we really gotta sort out this Gnosia stuff, you guys."
t_skill_roller,0,,,Annoyed,"All those who claimed to be the {0}. Hear my words, one and all.
The sacrifice you make today shall not be forgotten by mankind.
Freeze 'em ALL!"
t_skill_roller,1,,,Neutral,"In doing so, are we guaranteed to eliminate our enemy at once?
Not bad... Let us... Git 'er done."
t_skill_roller,2,,,Hurt,"So we are to toss away the {0}, as if they were mere tools?
Nay! This is not the sort of method which Daddy can abide!"
t_skill_roller,3,,,Happy,"I, too, agree not with freezing them.
NOPE, say I! NOPE!"
t_skill_roller,4,,,,...
t_skill_roller,5,,,,...
t_skill_roller,6,,,,...
t_skill_doTohyo,0,,,Hurt,"According to one {1}, {0} is, indeed, Gnosia.
So, says I, we must do away with the scourge that is {0}."
t_skill_doTohyo,1,,,Neutral,"Allow me to posit this to you all: Rememberest you mine RE-PORT?
In which I stated in no unclear language, that {0} is Gnosia?
Now I ask of you: Trust in me, and vote against {0}!"
t_skill_doTohyo,2,,,Neutral,"Fellows, cast your vote for {0}!
Let us cast those who would do us nasty into cold SLEEEEP!"
t_skill_doTohyo,3,,,Surprised,"{1}... {1}.
You propose, based upon lies, that we should be rid of {0}...
Well, like, no. Just no. So there."
t_skill_doTohyo,4,,,Happy,"Hm... A PLAN, I see?
I love me a good plan. My vote shall be for {0}."
t_skill_doTohyo,5,,,Annoyed,"So you would send me to the frosty, crispy naptime, would you?
Is this a joke? For you see me laugh not!"
t_skill_doTohyo,6,,,Thinking,"Cast our votes for {0}, says you?
Well, that's just... nuh-uh."
t_skill_doTohyo,7,,,Happy,"Such a proposal, at such a moment in time...
Am I the only one to see through your... SHENANIGANS?"
t_skill_dontTohyo,0,,,,...
t_skill_dontTohyo,1,,,Neutral,"I see, this would seem to be the most appropriate move.
I hereby submit my promise NOT to vote for {0}, pinky swear."
t_skill_dontTohyo,2,,,Hurt,"No. We have no reason to remove {0} from the vote.
Or have we? Nay, we have not..."
t_skill_dontTohyo,3,,,Happy,"Tis a shame, {1}.
Your proposal lacks a certain... something. Something, like... you know. Something."
t_skill_kyoryoku,0,,,,...
t_skill_kyoryoku,1,,,Smug,"I understand...
Let the Heavens and the Earth smile upon us.
{0}, let us kick in the bathroom door of fate - TOGETHER!"
t_skill_kyoryoku,2,,,Hurt,"Me? Joining forces with you?
'Tis but a dream. A silly, silly dream."
t_skill_t_doui,0,,,Hurt,"Hm, there is indeed good reason to give {0}'s opinion import.
Let us all hear said opinion, with our own respective earballs!"
t_skill_t_hanronKinshi,0,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,0,,,Thinking,"I, too, have been thinking the same.
Allowing {1} to roam free would put us all in mortal PERIL!"
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,1,,,Smug,"Hehe... Alright.
For my dear friend {1}, I, Jonas, shall place my very ass on the proverbial ""line""."
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,2,,,Happy,"I, too, agree with {2}.
Feel you not that {0}'s opinion stumbles far from the path of sense-making?!"
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,3,,,Happy,"Ah... I could not conceive a vote for {1}.
Do we all not agree?"
t_skill_h_uyamuya,0,,,Hurt,"Do away with petty arguments, and open thine earballs!
Hark! Can you not hear the stars as they sing...?"
t_skill_h_hangeki,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_dojo,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,1,,,Neutral,"Before seeking help from another, try helpin' yourself, bro.
Therein lies the key to looking not like a damn freeloader."
t_skill_h_careful,0,,,,...
t_skill_dogeza,0,,,Happy,"Ah, the art of groveling in desperation.
An art I had thought was long lost.
Witness, a true artist at work…"
t_skill_dogeza,1,,,,...
t_personal,0,0,,Annoyed,"Hehe... Bwahahahahaaa!
That I myself could be an enemy of humanity!
If this is so, then I ask you... What, exactly, am I...?"
t_personal,0,1,,Hurt,"Waste not your energy, {0}.
Your sentence has been declared, and shall be now carried out.
Y'all ready for this?!"
t_personal,0,2,,Happy,"Make an enemy of me, and how long do you believe you would last?
Hehe... This is gonna be fun, {0}."
t_personal,0,3,,Neutral,"This is a hunt! A hunt for the most dangerous game...
Just as we, as humans, have lived for eons."
t_personal,0,4,,Neutral,"{0}, place you not your trust in me, Jonas?
Hehe, you could place a much worse bet..."
t_personal,0,5,,Smug,"What's wrong, my old friend?
Your pain is my pain. Let it all out, homie!"
t_personal,0,6,,Neutral,"To trust is to be betrayed.
To love is to be betrayed.
Hehe, damn... this is a hard one."
t_personal,0,7,,Happy,"{0}, I am your ally.
I mean... you know.
Truth or lie, dream or reality... Know you not which? Hehehehe."
t_personal,0,8,,Happy,"According to that which mine eyeballs hath seen... {0}.
Art thou not mine ENEMY?!"
t_personal,0,9,,Happy,"Tonight... is the night.
Gonna make some sacrifices and feel alright."
t_personal,0,10,,Smug,"You for I, and I for you...
Hehe, sounds good. We are now brethren in war!"
t_personal,0,11,,Hurt,"Victory falls upon the elbows of the mantis!
'Tis now the time for {0}, in search of the wigglybum dancer?"
t_personal,0,12,,Hurt,"Waste not your energy, {0}.
Your sentence has been declared, and shall be now carried out.
Y'all ready for this?!"
t_personal,0,13,,Smug,"Now, let us toast!
To strange encounters, surpassing space and time!"
t_personal,0,14,,Happy,"Have you come solely to doubt my intentions?
Hehe, cautious - I like that."
t_personal,0,15,,Thinking,"I cannot understand. Why would you make an enemy of me?
That's, like... super dangerous, bro..."
t_personal,0,16,,Thinking,"Let the records show, we now begin our anti-Gnosian venture!
The circumstances are vague, and our chances are, well... Let's just do it."
t_personal,1,0,,Thinking,"The truth can be found within a lie.
This applies especially to us now."
t_personal,1,1,,Hurt,"Yes, {1}, indeed, speaks lies. BUT!
These lies shall lead us to the TRUTH!
The truth that {1} is totally an enemy of HUMANITY!"
t_personal,1,2,,Happy,"Hehe, the truth can be a cruel thing indeed...
{1} has taken on the cross.
'Tis now up to us to carry out the burial."
t_personal,2,0,,Neutral,"Lo, {0}!
The believers are heading off to the gallows as we speak!"
t_personal,2,1,,Hurt,"Loo loo-loo-loo loooo, Loo loo-loo-loo loooo..."
t_personal,3,0,,Thinking,"The stormwinds blow...
The stormwinds known as... GNOSIA."
t_personal,3,1,,Hurt,"Yes. We humans...
We must huddle together to wait out the storms of, um... naughtiness..."
t_personal,3,2,,Neutral,"{0}, oh {0}.
Let us join together in our struggle against that which is bad and naughty!"
t_personal,4,0,,Smug,"DETERMINATION!
You chose... wisely. Nice one, bro."
t_personal,5,0,,Thinking,"Hm...
I mean, fine, BE like that then..."
t_personal,5,1,,Happy,"You must forge your own path.
I only pray that said path does not, like... be... bad?"
t_personal,6,0,,Neutral,"Ah, so you wish to lean upon the wisdom of Jonas.
To decide whom shall be disappeared on this night..."
t_personal,6,1,,Thinking,"Well then... How's about {1}?
Seems like a nice, crunchy lil' Gnosia snack, eh?"
t_personal,6,2,,Happy,"Hehe... I cannot wait for the warp.
The pleasure in seeing {1} gone. The heart trembles in anticipation."
t_personal,7,0,,Hurt,"(Oh, {1}. You're the one.
 You are now with eternity…)"
t_personal,8,0,,Hurt,"I, Jonas, hath been...
Been... like, written about... In poems... and stuff."
t_personal,8,1,,Smug,"And now, as tragedy strikes this very ship...
Once again I deliver inspiration to another generation of poets!"
t_personal,8,2,,Happy,"{0}. You should be proud.
After all, it was you, {0}, who fought together with JONAS!"
t_personal,9,0,,Thinking,"Let the record show that the Gnosia pose no more threat.
The danger has passed. Like, totally passed. For realsies."
t_personal,10,0,,Hurt,"Ah...
And so it ends.
Good work. Good work indeed, {0}."
t_personal,10,1,,Happy,"While enemies, we escaped the fatal claws of the Gnosia together.
The enemy of my enemy is, like... not so bad after all."
t_personal,11,0,,Neutral,"Now, {0}. Let us raise a toast!
A toast to... nice... stuff!"
t_personal,11,1,,Smug,"To VICTORY!
And also, to the friendships fostered among this mortal danger!"
t_personal,12,0,,Hurt,"HOWEVER...
While they may be our enemy, I pity the Gnosia."
t_personal,12,1,,Happy,"The moment they set foot on this, my ship...
Their fate had been sealed. Like, in a super bad way, too."
t_personal,13,0,,Thinking,"Humans find strength in numbers.
But if something foreign and malicious were to join those numbers...?"
t_personal,13,1,,Happy,"Hehe... Behold! This is what happens.
The great Gnosia know humans all too well."
t_personal,14,0,,Happy,"So, is this the end?
Heh... Worthless, cowardly humans.
As a former human, one almost feels shame."
