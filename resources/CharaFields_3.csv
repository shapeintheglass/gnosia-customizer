t_aisatu,0,,,,"I'm {0}. Remember it.
It's no exaggeration to say that the universe was born with me."
t_suspect,0,,,Neutral,"You're beyond redemption, {0}.
I sense no intelligence in you. Not in the slightest."
t_suspect,1,,,Annoyed,"{0}, you're casting the discussion into confusion.
Hmph... I'll rephrase it in a way even you can understand.
{0}, you're annoying. Shut up."
t_suspect,2,,,Thinking,"Why do you all trust {0}?
I'll never understand how commoners think..."
t_suspect,3,,,Surprised,"Pressing on those who stay suspiciously quiet, like {0}, sounds prudent."
t_suspect,4,,,Neutral,"Thinking logically, we should probably be suspecting...
{0}, I feel."
t_suspect,5,,,Happy,"{0}, are you hiding something?"
t_suspect,6,,,Happy,"OK, this is where my aliance with {0} ends.
In case it wasn't obvious, {0} doesn't deserve our trust."
t_suspect,7,,,Surprised,"So last night, it was {1} who disappeared.
Well then, haha, isn't it clear whom we should suspect?
{0}. You."
t_suspect_r,0,,,Happy,"Hm... I guess {0} is irredeemable after all.
No real purpose left to serve for us."
t_suspect_r,1,,,Thinking,"Shut up, {0}.
You're only serving to exacerbate my dislike of you."
t_suspect_r,2,,,Neutral,"{0} isn't worthy of our trust.
I tried trusting {0}, but it turned out to be completely pointless."
t_suspect_r,3,,,Surprised,"{0}. Speak up more, and show your true self.
I have high expectations of you."
t_suspect_r,4,,,Happy,"OK, I'm going to suspect {0}.
I mean, logically, it only makes sense, right?"
t_suspect_r,5,,,Happy,"You know what? I trust {0}.
So to make a change in the situation, I'm gonna try doubting {0} now."
t_suspect_r,6,,,,...
t_suspect_r,7,,,,...
t_suspect_add,0,,,Happy,"{0} seems pretty suspicious, right?
Just sort of too pathetic to be an actual human."
t_suspect_t0,0,,,Happy,"I like how this is going...
I'd like to see {0} go into cold sleep."
t_suspect_t0,1,,,Smug,"Haha, how annoying, and suspicious to boot.
What are you doing, {0}? Are you up for election or something?"
t_suspect_t0,2,,,Surprised,"Huh... That's not bad, {1}.
I think we should start focusing on {0} about now."
t_suspect_t0,3,,,Happy,"Just what are you hiding, {0}?
You don't actually HAVE to answer, you know."
t_suspect_t0,4,,,Happy,"It's clear what's going on here.
Is there really anyone who doesn't suspect {0}?"
t_suspect_t0,5,,,Surprised,"So I see I wasn't the only one suspecting {0}.
You're starting to come around, I guess."
t_suspect_t0,6,,,Annoyed,Of course suspicions arise. {0} is just so untrustworthy.
t_suspect_t1,0,,,Happy,"So basically, {1} dislikes - and therefore wants to freeze - {0}.
Haha. Well, why not?"
t_suspect_t1,1,,,Annoyed,"{0} screwed up.
They've lost my trust."
t_suspect_t1,2,,,Surprised,"Heh, so now we're going to jump on {0}?
Sure, I'll take that ride, haha."
t_suspect_t1,3,,,Happy,It's only natural to cast doubt upon those who keep quiet.
t_suspect_t1,4,,,Surprised,"Huh, a rational opinion. How rare. I support it."
t_suspect_t1,5,,,Smug,"Hey, you sure have become unpopular, {0}.
Of course no one would trust someone like you!"
t_suspected0,0,,,Neutral,Huh... Are you really doubting me?
t_suspected0,1,,,Annoyed,"Resorting to ad hominem attacks due to lack of actual reason?
What kind of idiot lets that sort of thing shake them up?"
t_hanron0,0,,,Thinking,"{0} isn't the one we should be suspecting right now.
I mean, come on... really?"
t_hanron0,1,,,Hurt,"You just don't get it, do you?
This whole trend of casting doubt on {0} is clearly some kind of ploy."
t_hanron1,0,,,Smug,"I support {0}.
Seeing {0} like this is just too pathetic. Haha!"
t_hanron_t0,0,,,Smug,I say {0} is alright. Aren't I such a good person? Ahaha!
t_hanron_t1,0,,,Surprised,"If {1} says one thing, I think we should assume the opposite is true."
t_trust,0,,,Happy,"{0}, you're actually not so bad.
I actually think I can trust you."
t_trust,1,,,Neutral,"Well, let me just say I feel we can trust {0}."
t_trust,2,,,Annoyed,Are there really any idiots here who would suspect {0}?
t_trust_r,0,,,Happy,"Personally, I want to avoid sending {0} off to cold sleep.
I like watching {0} squirm and fight."
t_trust_r,1,,,Thinking,"As for whom we should allow to remain...
Unfortunately, {0} just seems to trustworthy to let go."
t_trust_r,2,,,Happy,"I've actually been observing {0} for awhile now.
{0} is clear, and deserves our trust."
t_trust_t0,0,,,Neutral,I agree. {0} should be allowed to remain.
t_trust_t1,0,,,Neutral,I agree. There are others we should be attacking before {0}.
t_trusted0,0,,,Smug,"Huh... Are you trying to form an alliance with me?
What a wise choice, ahahaha!"
t_thanron0,0,,,Surprised,"I don't have a single reason to trust {0}, personally."
t_thanron1,0,,,Annoyed,"Hmph, looks like {0} and {1} are colluding.
I don't trust people like that."
t_thanron_t0,0,,,Neutral,"Just what is ""trust"", anyway? Some sort of religious term?"
t_thanron_t1,0,,,Neutral,Do you think I'd have a reason to follow {0}?
t_hosho,0,,,Neutral,"It's obvious, but I feel it's safe to say that {0} is the {1}."
t_hosho,1,,,Neutral,"OK, there's no longer any need to doubt {0}.
As anticlimactic as it may be, {0} is clearly human."
t_hosho_enemy,0,,,Surprised,"OK, you must all have noticed by now, right?
{0} couldn't possibly be {1}."
t_hosho_enemy,1,,,Annoyed,"{0} is the {1}.
Hah, did you think I would somehow miss this?"
t_hosho_enemy,2,,,Surprised,"Wow, to think that {0} is the {1}.
Hey, {0}. I don't get it myself, but is it fun to live according to an ideology?"
t_hosho_enemy,3,,,Thinking,"{0}... Just what are you?
A {1}...? Attempting to throw the universe into chaos...?"
t_hosho_enemy,4,,,Smug,"Haha, you've screwed up, {0}.
Your argument makes no sense.
You're screwed now. Ahahahaha!"
t_hosho_enemy,5,,,Happy,"Aa, I see. So, {0}, then.
So you're an AC Follower, or a Bug."
t_hosho_miss,0,,,Surprised,"You're trying so hard, {0}.
But, you're all wrong, haha."
t_hosho_miss,1,,,Thinking,"Yeah, we already know that, you know?
{0}, stop making useless comments.
You yourself are starting to feel useless."
t_hosho_get,0,,,Surprised,"Did you all really just realize now that I'm {1}?
Haha, no, of course not, right?"
t_hosho_get,1,,,Annoyed,"I seem to have underestimated you all. And now, here we are.
I'm not angry, I know I have to calmly accept my fate now.
I admire how deftly you entrapped me, actually."
t_tohyo_go,0,,,Neutral,"There's no more point in debating.
I think we should get on with the vote."
t_tohyo_mae,0,,,Happy,"Let's stop debating and vote.
Hooray for democracy, haha."
t_tohyo_sai,0,,,Neutral,"So we have the results...
We'll vote again between {0}."
t_shokei,0,,,Annoyed,"So I'm gone, then, hm? You're all beyond salvation.
Like a bunch of lemmings. But that's fine with me. I don't care.
I'll accept my death sentence. In fact, I welcome it."
t_shokei,1,,,Thinking,Hmph...!
t_wakare,0,,,Hurt,"{0}, I'm disappointed in you."
t_karare,0,,,Surprised,"You're the {0}? And you've come to eliminate me?
Aha, this is amusing. Ahahahahahaha..."
t_imjinro,0,,,Gnosia,"That's right, I'm {0}. It's obvious, isn't it?
Me! Did you really think I was some stupid human?!
You really are stupid! Ahahahahahahahaaaaa!"
t_shori,0,,,Happy,"So it seems I've beaten the {0}.
Or rather, we've beaten them, I guess..."
t_tohyo_kurikaeshi,0,,,Annoyed,"Oh come on...
You aren't all stupid enough to keep redoing the vote, are you?"
t_tohyo_jeno,0,,,Smug,"So, we just need to put all of the candidates into cold sleep, right?
Suspicion itself is a sin, after all. This is how we royalty handle such matters, haha."
t_tohyo_alive,0,,,Thinking,"Hmph, {0}...
I think we should keep them all here, strength in numbers and all..."
t_tohyo_jeno_ok,0,,,Surprised,"Swift and decisive.
I'm behind it. Let us put them all into cold sleep."
t_tohyo_jeno_ng,0,,,Happy,"I object. I don't like the idea, nor that it was YOUR idea."
t_tohyo_alive_ok,0,,,Neutral,"OK, fine, let them all stay, then."
t_tohyo_alive_ng,0,,,Happy,I don't like it.
t_tohyo_jeno_kettei,0,,,Smug,"OK... Everyone is off to cold sleep!
What, isn't this clearly the answer?"
t_tohyo_alive_kettei,0,,,Happy,"OK... So we let them all remain.
I'll be off now. I'm busy."
t_tohyo_hitei,0,,,Annoyed,"Hm... So you reject my proposal.
Well then, do any of you have a better idea?"
t_tohyo_dame,0,,,Hurt,"Haah... Let's just give up for tonight.
I'm... getting sleepy..."
t_tohyo_dame,1,,,Thinking,"Let's leave it here for tonight...
Nothing good is going to come of this anyway."
t_co,0,,,,dammy
t_co,1,,,Happy,"I'm the {0}. Give me 16 hours and I'll find the Gnosia.
All you need to do is get rid of them once they're found."
t_co,2,,,Happy,"You're all so lucky that I'm the {0}, huh?
I can tell who is or isn't Gnosia, so keep freezing anyone suspicious."
t_co,3,,,Neutral,"I'm a {0}. I'm sure fools can't tell the difference, though.
Battle requires brains, not brawn."
t_co,4,,,Smug,"I'm sure you'd all like to get rid of me. Haha, well too bad!
When we last docked, I remained here on the ship.
So there's no way I could've been infected by the Gnosia."
t_co,5,,,,dammy
t_co,6,,,,dammy
t_co,7,,,,dammy
t_co,8,,,,dammy
t_co_find,0,,,,dammy
t_co_find,1,,,Annoyed,"I'm the {0}. I kept quiet about it as a strategy.
And {1} is Gnosia. Do away with them quickly."
t_co_find,2,,,Happy,"There was an idiot Gnosia in cold sleep. It was {1}.
That's right, I was the {0}."
t_co_find,3,,,,dammy
t_co_find,4,,,,dammy
t_co_find,5,,,,dammy
t_co_find,6,,,,dammy
t_co_find,7,,,,dammy
t_co_find,8,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,0,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,1,,,Surprised,"Hm... So {1} isn't human.
It's simple. I know this because I'm the only true {0} here."
t_co_taiko,2,,,Thinking,"You've made a bad call, {1}.
Making an enemy of me, the only true {0} on this ship."
t_co_taiko,3,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,4,,,Smug,"I can confirm. {1} and I remained here on the ship.
So our alibis are solid! Haha!"
t_co_taiko,5,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,6,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,7,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,8,,,,dammy
t_co_req,0,,,Neutral,I think the {0} should make themselves known now.
t_co_after,0,,,Happy,"{1} is the {0}?
Let's just hope they're not in over their head."
t_co_after,1,,,Neutral,"I just want to say that among {1}, one of them is a fake.
I mean, they may both be fakes, actually. We'll see."
t_co_after,2,,,Smug,"Ahaha! A war over the position of {0}!
Thanks, all of you.
This will help weed out the Gnosia."
t_uranai_o,0,,,Thinking,"Wow, you're trying to discredit my research?"
t_uranai_s,0,,,,"Allow me to report my findings.
"
t_uranai_b,0,,,,"Hmph. Well, next is my own report.
"
t_uranai_t,0,,,Smug,"Put simply, {1} is {0}. Ahaha!"
t_uranai_f,0,,,Neutral,"{1} wasn't {0}. Haah...
{1} is suspicious, anyway, you think about it."
t_uranai_n,0,,,Neutral,"Further investigation would just be pointless, wouldn't it?"
t_reibai_s,0,,,,"I've already examined those in cold sleep.
"
t_reibai_s,1,,,,...
t_reibai_t,0,,,Happy,"{1} {3} {0}. That much is clear.
Let's keep it up with the cold sleep."
t_reibai_f,0,,,Neutral,"{1} isn't {0}, just a normal human.
I had expected more."
t_reibai_ft,0,,,Happy,"Among {1}, {2} {4} {0}.
Not bad, I guess."
t_reibai_ff,0,,,Neutral,"{1} were all normal humans. Hah, we were way off."
t_houkoku_s,0,,,Happy,"Hmph. Well, I guess I believe you. I got the same results myself."
t_houkoku_w,0,,,Annoyed,"Haha, no. The fake has shown their hand!"
t_okuyami,0,,,Neutral,"Another one was taken out?
Our ability to fight is being gradually whittled down..."
t_okuyami_n,0,,,Smug,"Ahahaha, the Gnosia is pretty stupid, I see.
Wasting an opportunity to attack like that."
t_okuyami_f,0,,,Surprised,"The victims were {0}? Hm...
It's simple. One of them was a Bug."
t_houkoku_req,0,,,Neutral,"Someone has a report to give, right? Hurry it up."
t_houkoku_not,0,,,Neutral,"OK, let's get the debate going.
I'm sure {0} will get plenty of votes, dodging the report like that."
t_skill_sayNingen,0,,,,...
t_skill_sayNingen,1,,,Surprised,"Hm, so you want to make the fake lie, huh?
I don't care much for these tactics.
Oh well, either way I'm human, so I don't care."
t_skill_sayNingen,2,,,Thinking,"I refuse.
I don't like these antiquated tactics."
t_skill_sayNingen,3,,,,...
t_skill_sayNingen,4,,,,...
t_skill_sayNingen,5,,,,...
t_skill_sayNingen,6,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,0,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,1,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,2,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,3,,,Happy,"So, you're a foodie, are you?
Supplements are sufficient for both essential nutrients and appetite control, aren't they?"
t_skill_zatsudan,4,,,Surprised,"The mental function of the mating instinct has long been understood.
IS there something about it you don't understand?"
t_skill_zatsudan,5,,,Hurt,"Recently, I feel as though someone is watching me in the shower.
It's more creepy than scary, really."
t_skill_zatsudan,6,,,Neutral,"I don't like this...
{0}. You simply don't like me, do you?"
t_skill_roller,0,,,Happy,"I came up with an idea even all of you could understand.
It's simple. All who claimed to be the {0} go into cold sleep.
It's clear that there's a fake among them, right?"
t_skill_roller,1,,,Surprised,"Not bad. So a sacrifice, basically?
The true {0} and the fakes will all sleep together.
We should build them a monument."
t_skill_roller,2,,,Hurt,"Put those who claimed to be the {0} into cold sleep... And then what?
That won't work, {1}. You have no vision."
t_skill_roller,3,,,Neutral,"Why don't we just leave them alone?
The fake will make a mistake at some point anyway."
t_skill_roller,4,,,Smug,"Ahaha, the next vote will be a test of intelligence.
Anyone with a functioning brain would vote for them, after all."
t_skill_roller,5,,,Thinking,"Well, voting for them would be best at this point, I guess.
Ignore my plan and do as you like, if you want to die."
t_skill_roller,6,,,Happy,"This is pointless. Why not put them all into cold sleep?
I doubt any of you could find another way to find the fake anyway."
t_skill_doTohyo,0,,,Surprised,"Let's just put {0} into cold sleep.
Didn't you hear {1}'s assessment? {0} is Gnosia."
t_skill_doTohyo,1,,,Neutral,"Can we just hurry up and put {0} into cold sleep?
Were you not listening? {0} is Gnosia."
t_skill_doTohyo,2,,,Happy,"Seriously, just hurry up and put {0} into cold sleep.
They're a fake, after all."
t_skill_doTohyo,3,,,Thinking,"Are you memories getting mixed up, {1}?
I didn't hear any report saying that."
t_skill_doTohyo,4,,,Neutral,"We don't have enough evidence for the rest anyway.
So how about we just vote for {0}?"
t_skill_doTohyo,5,,,Smug,"Ahahahaha, so is this what's known as mob rule?
But {1}, are you really that much of an instigator?"
t_skill_doTohyo,6,,,Neutral,"Let's stop this, it's wasteful.
I mean, I won't miss {0}, but I don't like seeing a turn to attack go to waste."
t_skill_doTohyo,7,,,Happy,Haha. This is just stupid.
t_skill_dontTohyo,0,,,Happy,"You don't all actually plan on voting for {0}, do you?
We don't have anyone that dumb on this ship, do we?"
t_skill_dontTohyo,1,,,Neutral,"I don't need {1} to tell me that.
Not even a monkey would be dumb enough to vote for {0}."
t_skill_dontTohyo,2,,,Happy,"So {1} is trying to tamper with the vote, hm?
Hah, there's obviously no way I'm going to allow this."
t_skill_dontTohyo,3,,,Annoyed,"Hah, I don't take orders from {1}."
t_skill_kyoryoku,0,,,,...
t_skill_kyoryoku,1,,,Smug,"So, you want to form an alliance, hm?
Ahaha, how surprisingly clever of you to choose me, {0}.
Alright, I guess I'll allow it."
t_skill_kyoryoku,2,,,Neutral,"{0}, even if I were to align myself with you,
what merit would be in it for me?
None whatsoever."
t_skill_t_doui,0,,,,...
t_skill_t_hanronKinshi,0,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,0,,,Surprised,"{1}. Just what were you doing last night?
Haha, you don't have to answer. I already know what you are."
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,1,,,Happy,"Yes, {0}.
The kind of commoners who would seek to freeze {1} should be done away with."
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,2,,,Annoyed,"Hah, what a joke.
If {2} wasn't against it, I would be anyway.
Is it even worth listening to what {0} has to say?"
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,3,,,Annoyed,"Exactly.
Voting for {1} in this situation would only benefit the enemy."
t_skill_h_uyamuya,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_hangeki,0,,,Annoyed,"Hah, trying to attack me in desperation, are you?
It's pointless. It's clear that {0} is more suspicious than I am."
t_skill_h_dojo,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,1,,,Smug,"Ahahahaha! {0} wants help from me?
That's funny. Watching you act so recklessly is amusing.
You'll get no help from me."
t_skill_h_careful,0,,,,...
t_skill_dogeza,0,,,Annoyed,"Hah, {0}. You really know no shame.
Did you really think you'd be forgiven?
Go on, kiss the floor! Harder!"
t_skill_dogeza,1,,,,...
t_personal,0,0,,Thinking,"What...? Have you come to gloat over my mistakes?
Hah, that's why I dislike you. Sure, I made a mistake, but you aren't one to talk.
Are you here to punish me somehow? Hah!"
t_personal,0,1,,Smug,"Ahahahaha, you've really screwed up now, {0}.
Do you want to know why?
By letting me live! Ahahahaha!"
t_personal,0,2,,Happy,"Have you come to grovel and beg for forgiveness...?
It doesn't matter. You will receive none."
t_personal,0,3,,Neutral,"I'm fully aware that you're human.
I just don't yet know if you're intelligent enough to be called one."
t_personal,0,4,,Neutral,"Hmph... You seem relaxed.
I wouldn't let you live if I were Gnosia."
t_personal,0,5,,Neutral,"{0}... Unlike you, I'm busy.
All I can really do for you is to try to guess what will happen next.
Maybe LeVi could help you out a bit."
t_personal,0,6,,Surprised,"Haha, coming to see me was a smart move.
Maybe you aren't as dumb as I had thought?"
t_personal,0,7,,Happy,"Just what would I get from talking to you?
Your friendship? Haha."
t_personal,0,8,,Neutral,"Go back, {0}.
I have nothing to say to you."
t_personal,0,9,,Surprised,"I wonder who will be eliminated tonight?
I'll be looking forward to seeing whom you choose, {0}."
t_personal,0,10,,Neutral,"We may have formed an alliance, sure.
But I'll cut you off if you hold me back, so be careful."
t_personal,0,11,,Annoyed,"Open the land, open the land. Hah. All I see if cinnamon.
Why not get some hair on your chest?"
t_personal,0,12,,Surprised,"Hey, so the dead walk, and they come to me, huh?"
t_personal,0,13,,Neutral,"You look bored. Why not help me with my research?
Hand me that... no, not that one...
No, the one next to it...! NO, not THAT one! Ah, never mind, just leave!"
t_personal,0,14,,Annoyed,"Could it be...? No...
You don't actually think your time is as valuable as mine, do you?"
t_personal,0,15,,Thinking,"I really feel the vastness of the universe now.
To think that someone as unpleasant as you could exist here..."
t_personal,0,16,,Happy,"We simply need to weed out and destroy the fake, right?
Hah, that's so simple, it's stupid. Let's hurry up and get started."
t_personal,1,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,2,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,3,0,,Thinking,"Hmph, {0}..."
t_personal,3,1,,Neutral,"Well, I don't have many other options, I guess.
You'll do for now."
t_personal,3,2,,Happy,"Haha, lucky you, {0}. You're pretty fortunate, you know.
Acquiring a collaborator like myself."
t_personal,4,0,,Hurt,"Of course.
Do you even need to ask...?"
t_personal,4,1,,Happy,"From here on out, just act as instructed.
Doubt those I point out, and vote for them, that's all.
Haha, even you could do this, right?"
t_personal,5,0,,Thinking,"I have to admit, I do have my regrets...
I regret underestimating the depths of your utter stupidity."
t_personal,5,1,,Neutral,"I can't believe I sought to collaborate with the likes of you.
I should thank you for helping me notice my own poor judgment."
t_personal,5,2,,Annoyed,"I have nothing to thank you for.
Get out."
t_personal,6,0,,Surprised,"Hey, {0}. Should you really be playing around in a place like this?
Have you decided who will be eliminated tonight?
Of course not. Of course you haven't."
t_personal,6,1,,Happy,"I did some thinking for you myself.
This time, we should get rid of {1}.
It's the obvious choice, considering the circumstances."
t_personal,6,2,,Neutral,"I'll let you decide, though.
Just remember that I proposed {1}.
Got it...? {1}, OK?"
t_personal,7,0,,Neutral,"(OK...
Victory is finally coming within reach.)"
t_personal,7,1,,Happy,"(You understand, don't you?
You just have to do as I say.)"
t_personal,8,0,,Neutral,"So it seems I've won.
Or rather, we've won, I guess..."
t_personal,8,1,,Happy,"{0}, you, too, proved useful.
I learned something from you."
t_personal,8,2,,Smug,"You need to use vermin to get rid of vermin.
Haha, right?"
t_personal,9,0,,Happy,"So, a win for the humans.
Haha, do you expect me to congratulate you or something?"
t_personal,10,0,,Neutral,"Oh, is that it...? Hmph...
I had thought you were pretty suspicious, {0}.
It's unfortunate I was wrong."
t_personal,10,1,,Smug,"I guess you're not Gnosia, just a normal, dodgy person then, right, {0}?
Haha, I'm not sure which is actually worse."
t_personal,11,0,,Neutral,"Well, I guess you tried your best, hm?
As well as you could, at least."
t_personal,12,0,,Happy,"The more I think about it... Hehe.
If I were Gnosia, the results would've been the exact opposite."
t_personal,12,1,,Surprised,"You should be thankful.
For having me on the same side, that is."
t_personal,13,0,,Neutral,"Is that all? What a shame...
Well, we knew how it would end anyway, since I'm on the Gnosia side.
The humans actually didn't do so bad."
t_personal,14,0,,Smug,"Ahahahaha How weak! Humans are SO weak!
I would've liked them to have tried a bit harder."
t_personal,14,1,,Surprised,"Ah, {0}. You seem to want something, hm?
Well, here you go. Good job, {0}. Nice work. Great.
Ahaha, is that good enough for you?"
t_personal,15,0,,Happy,"By the way, I could take over this ship anytime I please, you know.
Where I go, what I do - it's all up to me."
t_personal,15,1,,Gnosia,"Haha, ahahahahaha! Gnosia forever!
I'm FREE!"
t_personal,16,0,,Happy,"OK, which solar system should we destroy next?
It's going to be fun, {0}!"
t_personal,16,1,,Hurt,"What are you doing? Hurry up and get prepared.
I'm taking you with me, you know. Obviously."
t_personal,17,0,,Happy,"Good work, {0}.
That will do."
t_personal,17,1,,Gnosia,"A conclusion has been reached!
The Gnosia... no, I! I've won!
