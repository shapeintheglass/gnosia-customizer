You talk way too much."

Check it out. That face just screams fraud."

I just can't trust people who need to be liked by everyone."

You look real suspicious, keeping all quiet like that.
I just can't trust you, ya know?"

t_suspect_t0,2,,,Happy,"{0}, you thought you'd escape suspicion, didn't you?
Guess that didn't really work out now, did it?"
t_suspect_t0,3,,,Smug,Shutting up like that makes me think one thing - guilty.

Don't be like that. The truth'll come out anyway."
t_suspect_t1,2,,,Smug,"Hey wait, seriously?! Are we gonna go for {0}?
OK then, let's do it!"
t_suspect_t1,3,,,Thinking,"Damn, I just can't back you up anymore."
t_suspect_t1,4,,,Thinking,"So we're suspecting {0} now, right? OK, cool."
t_suspect_t1,5,,,Thinking,"{0}? Yeah. To be honest, I've had my suspicions, too."
t_suspected0,0,,,Thinking,"You're suspecting me? That's just stupid.
Any way you look at it, I'm in the clear."
t_suspected0,1,,,Annoyed,"Hey, get off my case.
You trying to get me depressed or something?"
t_hanron0,0,,,Annoyed,"Suspecting {0} now, huh? That's just stupid.
I trust {0}, myself."

But there's just something about {0} that I like..."

Chances are high that we got nothing to worry about."

So don't go betraying that trust now, got it?"

Just go easy on me, OK?"

Well, neither do I... How about we start the vote?"
t_tohyo_mae,0,,,Hurt,"Well, let's get voting, I guess.
OK, so who do we freeze today...?"
t_tohyo_sai,0,,,Surprised,"A tie?! That's a surprise.
So we gotta vote again, with {0} then, huh?"
t_shokei,0,,,Hurt,"So I'm going off to cold sleep, huh...?
It's gonna get lonely without me, ya know?"
t_shokei,1,,,Surprised,"And? So I gotta go off to cold sleep then, right?
No torture, no punishment?
Damn, could be worse, I guess..."

What the hell are you doing, man?"

You're coming after ME now?!
That's messed up, man..."

How about we just freeze 'em all?"

No cold sleep for today - what do you say?"
t_tohyo_jeno_ok,0,,,Neutral,Fine with me. Freeze 'em.

Frozen meat starts to stink, ya know."

t_tohyo_alive_ng,0,,,Annoyed,"Nope, I don't like it.
Your idea just kinda sucks."
t_tohyo_jeno_kettei,0,,,Happy,"OK, let's get this freeze going before I change my mind.
The fridge is ready to go, right?"
t_tohyo_alive_kettei,0,,,Thinking,"So we're just gonna leave it, then?
Fine, let's call it a day, I guess."
t_tohyo_hitei,0,,,Hurt,"Wait a second...
No way... Am I kinda, uh... disliked here?"

I'm gonna split."
t_tohyo_dame,1,,,,...
t_co,0,,,,...
t_co,1,,,Smug,"The {0} is me, Sha-Ming.
OK, let's see who I'm gonna check out..."
t_co,2,,,Neutral,"I can tell if someone frozen was Gnosia or not.
I'm the {0}.
You can call me {0} Sha-Ming."
t_co,3,,,Smug,"I'm a {0}, so I'm gonna protect you guys.
As long as I'm around, the Gnosia is gonna have to watch out."
t_co,4,,,Thinking,"Hey listen, I'm no Gnosia, OK?

My {0} sensors are really going haywire.
{1} is Gnosia!"

So the Gnosia's gonna use lies to get on the offensive, huh?
The real {0} is ME!"

I'M the {0}. Which means...
You're gonna make a pretty formidable enemy, ya know?"
t_co_taiko,3,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,4,,,Thinking,"I can vouch - {1} was on the ship the whole time, too.
No chance of Gnosia infection."

t_co_taiko,8,,,,dammy
t_co_req,0,,,Thinking,"And? So who's the {0}?
Come on out, like, now!"
t_co_after,0,,,Happy,"So {1}'s the {0}, huh? OK!
Sniff out that Gnosia for us!"
t_co_after,1,,,Thinking,"{1}. So you're supposed to be the {0}, huh?
Well, you're gonna have to try pretty hard to convince me."
t_co_after,2,,,Happy,"A-ha! Looks like everybody wants to be the {0}!
{1}.
You guys ready to get grilled? Hm?"
t_uranai_o,0,,,Hurt,"Hey, don't just walk away now..."

My sensors are sharp as hell."

There's nobody worth checking out."

t_reibai_t,0,,,Happy,{1} is {0}... Oh yeah!
t_reibai_f,0,,,Thinking,{1} is not {0}... Oops!
t_reibai_ft,0,,,Happy,{2} is {0}! Oh yes!
t_reibai_ff,0,,,Hurt,"We screwed up this time...
None of the people we froze were {0}."
t_houkoku_s,0,,,Smug,"Wow, we matched up. Check out my report."
t_houkoku_w,0,,,Smug,"Nope. Don't get fooled by this crap, you guys."
t_okuyami,0,,,Annoyed,"So {0} gets it this time, huh...
This Gnosia's really choosing their targets."
t_okuyami_n,0,,,Happy,"A-ha! So nobody got done last night?
Looks like our little enemy screwed up!"
t_okuyami_f,0,,,Surprised,"Hey, what the hell?! This wasn't supposed to...
The Gnosia only takes out one person at a time, right?!
Isn't that their M.O.?!"
t_houkoku_req,0,,,Neutral,"Someone hasn't reported yet, huh?"
t_houkoku_not,0,,,Neutral,"{0}, where's your report, huh?
You can't get past me, ya know?"

How about we all grab a bite to eat?"
t_skill_zatsudan,1,,,Neutral,"You guys look pretty on edge.
How about we talk about, I don't know, romance or something?
Anybody got anything juicy?"
t_skill_zatsudan,2,,,Thinking,"Come on, you guys! This sucks!
Let's talk about something more interesting...
How about, like, something scary as hell?"
t_skill_zatsudan,3,,,Hurt,"Ya know, the food on this ship is like, too healthy.
I wanna eat something BAD for me for once! Some chili cheese fries or something!"
t_skill_zatsudan,4,,,Happy,"Anybody wanna profess their love for me? Go for it!
No, really... Anybody? I'm open to any takers..."
t_skill_zatsudan,5,,,Neutral,"You guys ever heard of the face pox? Tiny faces, popping up all over you.
It's a real thing, seriously. I got them on my belly.
I'll show ya if you wanna see..."
t_skill_zatsudan,6,,,Smug,"You trying to get me to drop my guard with this crap?!
Hah, that kinda thing doesn't work on me!"
t_skill_roller,0,,,,...

Now this is what us humans are all about!"

You really wanna burn down the whole village to take out one weirdo?"

t_skill_doTohyo,2,,,,...
t_skill_doTohyo,3,,,Smug,"Huh? That's weird, {1}...
{0} is Gnosia? Did the Engineer say so?
Hah! I don't think so, pal!"
t_skill_doTohyo,4,,,Thinking,"Laying some groundwork before the vote, huh?
Nice try, {1}! That's pretty dirty!
I'll go with it, don't wanna be on the receiving end myself!"
t_skill_doTohyo,5,,,Surprised,"Seriously?! I... I guess so, huh..."
t_skill_doTohyo,6,,,Neutral,"Hey, I can vote for whoever I damn please!
Don't try to tell me what to do!"
t_skill_doTohyo,7,,,Thinking,"Listen, {1}.
I just can't get behind this, OK?"
t_skill_dontTohyo,0,,,,...
t_skill_dontTohyo,1,,,Neutral,"Huh, so that's how it's gonna be...
Yeah, OK. I wasn't gonna vote for {0} anyway."
t_skill_dontTohyo,2,,,Thinking,"I'm gonna vote for whoever I want.
Sometimes you end up changing your mind at the last second, ya know?"
t_skill_dontTohyo,3,,,Happy,"FREEDOM!
I'm gonna do whatever I want!"
t_skill_kyoryoku,0,,,Neutral,"{0}. I got your back.
Just trust me.
OK...?"
t_skill_kyoryoku,1,,,Happy,"Nice idea, {0}. I scratch your back, you scratch mine.
Help me out if I get in trouble, OK?"
t_skill_kyoryoku,2,,,Hurt,"I don't think so, {0}. I'm, uh...
Not the kinda dude you seem to think I am."
t_skill_t_doui,0,,,Happy,"Hey, what the hell, you guys?!
Just listen to {0} and do what you're told!"
t_skill_t_hanronKinshi,0,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,0,,,Happy,"A-ha! You're looking pretty sketchy there, {1}!
Worried you've been found out, huh?!"
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,1,,,Thinking,"So basically, {0} wants to protect {1}, right?
Hah! Brings a tear to my eye. What friendship...
Doesn't it just make you wanna cry?"
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,2,,,Neutral,"Well, basically, like {2} said...
I'm just not really feeling it, {0}."
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,3,,,Smug,"This is no time to be covering for {1}, pal.
Do you understand what's going on?!"
t_skill_h_uyamuya,0,,,Smug,"You're gonna have to choose your words a bit better, pal.
Bring it harder! Come on!"
t_skill_h_hangeki,0,,,Neutral,"What the hell is wrong with you, {0}?!
If anyone here is fishy, it's clearly YOU!"
t_skill_h_dojo,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,0,,,Happy,"{0}! Help me out here!
Haha, make sure you got my back, OK?"
t_skill_h_help,1,,,Annoyed,"What the...?! Don't drag ME into this!
I'm not letting you bring me down with you!"
t_skill_h_careful,0,,,,...
t_skill_dogeza,0,,,Surprised,"Really?! Like, seriously...?
Groveling like that, that's just sad, man…"
t_skill_dogeza,1,,,Thinking,"I... I... I'M SORRY...!
I'll kiss your ass, I'll do ANYTHING!
Hehe... Can we just let this slide, just this once...?"
t_personal,0,0,,Annoyed,"YOU! So you've come for me now, huh?!
Hey! Guardian Angel! LeVi! HELP...!
Wh-what...? Oh, hey, if that's not what's going on, then say so!"
t_personal,0,1,,Neutral,"You've already been found out, pal.
Don't think you haven't."
t_personal,0,2,,Surprised,"Hey, {0}. We're supposed to be enemies, right?
Keep your distance, pal. Don't try to get me all shook up like that."
t_personal,0,3,,Hurt,"Well, everyone knows I'm human, so...
Hopefully the Gnosia will go after you instead..."
t_personal,0,4,,Neutral,"Don't let your guard down just because you proved you're human.
That just makes you an easier target, ya know?"
t_personal,0,5,,Thinking,"Trust me. Seriously.
I totally trust you, just so you know."
t_personal,0,6,,Annoyed,"Listen, {0}... If I trust you, I'm worried I'm gonna take one in the back.
How about you? You get what I mean, right?"
t_personal,0,7,,Neutral,"What's wrong, {0}? You get attacked or something?
Better watch your step, or you just might be!"
t_personal,0,8,,Happy,"Damn, you smell that...? Smells like... LIES.
Where's that coming from...? Oh, it's YOU, {0}!"
t_personal,0,9,,Happy,"A-ha! It's party time!
Almost time for us to do our thing!"
t_personal,0,10,,Neutral,"You just waltz on in here like that? Be careful, pal...
You never know who's watching, right?"
t_personal,0,11,,Happy,"Hey! Time for the runway, ding-dong!
I'm the eel, and the eel is me! Right?!"
t_personal,0,12,,Neutral,"You've already been found out, pal.
Don't think you haven't."
t_personal,0,13,,Thinking,"Keep your guard up, {0}.
You never know what's gonna happen next..."
t_personal,0,14,,Surprised,"ASSASSINS!
Oh... it's just you, huh? {0}, don't come sneaking up on me like that."
t_personal,0,15,,Thinking,"Ya know, there's just something about you...
Like, you got this aura... This brown, stinky, crap-like aura."
t_personal,0,16,,Thinking,"OK, so everyone's here.
Yeah, I know, I know - the Gnosia, right?
OK, let's just get this started."
t_personal,1,0,,Neutral,"Hey, {0}.
You know what color a lie is?"
t_personal,1,1,,Annoyed,"It's white. Pure white.
It's the ones who look most in the clear that are hiding something."
t_personal,1,2,,Thinking,"Yeah, I picked up on it.
During the discussions, {1}'s teeth flashed white.
Those are the teeth of a liar, no doubt about it."
t_personal,1,3,,Smug,"Hey, why don't we take out {1}?
Before we gotta deal with anymore lies, let's put 'em to sleep."
t_personal,2,0,,Happy,"OK, that's one down.
Haha! Nice one, {0}!"
t_personal,2,1,,Smug,"I'm glad I opened up to you.
Let's keep this going, OK?"

The Gnosia Cup! Who gets the honor?!
Stay tuned to find out!"
t_personal,6,1,,Gnosia,"Hm...
OK, so like..."
t_personal,6,2,,Neutral,"How about we get rid of {1}?
Feels like a good place to start."
t_personal,7,0,,Thinking,"(OK.
Let's pick 'em off one at a time.)"
t_personal,8,0,,Surprised,"Hey now. Looks like we won.
All thanks to the great {0}!"
t_personal,8,1,,Happy,"To be honest, I took a pretty big risk teaming up with you.
But hey, it turned out to be a success!"
t_personal,8,2,,Thinking,"But seriously though, I'm really grateful.
Let me pay you back... physically!"
t_personal,8,3,,Smug,PHYSICALLY!
t_personal,9,0,,Surprised,"Really? Like, for reals really?! We win?
A-ha! Nice one!"
t_personal,10,0,,Neutral,"So, hey, {0}...
I guess you weren't Gnosia after all."
t_personal,10,1,,Hurt,"Why didn't you say something?!
If only you would've told me...
I mean, I wouldn't have believed you anyway, so... yeah."
t_personal,11,0,,Happy,"You know what that means, right?!
LET'S PAAAAARTYYYYY!"
t_personal,11,1,,Smug,"Hurry up! Get ready, you guys!
Let's get this party started!"
t_personal,12,0,,Thinking,"Man, that Gnosia was pretty weak, huh?
Who was it that was all scared of getting taken out?"
t_personal,12,1,,Smug,"It was ME! Yup, me!
So what? Get off my back!"
t_personal,13,0,,Thinking,"Okey-dokey!
So, we win, huh?"
t_personal,14,0,,Happy,"A-ha! That was too easy!
We all survived!"
t_personal,15,0,,Smug,"We gotta make a decision!
The Most Valuable Gnosia is..."
t_personal,15,1,,Happy,"{0}! YEAH!
It's You, buddy! ALRIGHT!"
t_personal,15,2,,Gnosia,So anyway... nice work.
t_personal,16,0,,Neutral,"Oh, and don't do anything to the remaining humans just yet.
I'll take care of them."
t_personal,16,1,,Thinking,"I mean, they let us win and all, right?
The least we can do is kill them nicely."
t_personal,17,0,,Happy,"Game OVER!
The winner is... GNOSIA! YEEEAAAH!"
t_personal,17,1,,Neutral,"Aw, what's wrong there, {0}?
You upset because you guys LOST?"
t_personal,17,2,,Hurt,"Buck up, pal.
I'll be gentle, OK.
I promise."
t_personal,18,0,,Annoyed,"Hah, what a load of crap.
Right, {0}?"
t_personal,18,1,,Hurt,"Yeah, I'm a Bug, so what?
My being here means the whole universe has to go.
Not that I care or anything."
t_personal,18,2,,Annoyed,"I bet some of you don't believe it, huh?
You think I'm joking? Well, just wait a second..."
t_personal,19,0,,Surprised,"Huh? So you were one of them AC Followers?
Daaamn! You're a good liar!"
t_personal,19,1,,Thinking,"I mean, I'm Gnosia, so...
I guess I'm not so bad at it myself, either."
t_personal,19,2,,Smug,"Anyway, we both survived.
Yay us, right? Right?!"
t_temp,0,,,,"High Stealth and low Intuition and Logic.
Focused on self-preservation,
he is very good at surviving."
