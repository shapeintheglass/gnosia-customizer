t_keisho,,,,,
t_aisatu,0,,,,My name is {0}. Pleased to meet you.
t_suspect,0,,,Surprised,"H-has nobody really noticed...?
{0}... scares me..."
t_suspect,1,,,Thinking,"Um, {0} seems to be, uh, maybe...
Standing out on purpose, to hide something..."
t_suspect,2,,,Annoyed,"So... everyone trusts {0}?
In that case... I guess I have nothing more to say."
t_suspect,3,,,Neutral,"You're... awfully quiet, {0}.
Why.... why is that?"
t_suspect,4,,,Surprised,"Thinking rationally, {0} seems pretty suspicious...
I'm sorry! B-but, you just are!"
t_suspect,5,,,Neutral,"{0}...
Seems somehow... strange to me..."
t_suspect,6,,,Smug,"I... I trusted... {0}.
But {0}...
I just... I just can't anymore."
t_suspect,7,,,Surprised,"Last night, {1} was attacked by...
But... no, no way...
Was it really... {0}?!"
t_suspect_r,0,,,Surprised,"I... Something's bothering me...
{0} sorta... makes this face sometimes...
It's kinda cold... and it spooks me!"
t_suspect_r,1,,,Thinking,"Um, {0}. Stand out like that too much, and...
It's kinda dangerous... Getting targeted and whatnot...
So, you know... what's up...?"
t_suspect_r,2,,,Hurt,"I-I... I, uh...
I don't think anyone'll listen, but...
I feel like something's off... with {0}."
t_suspect_r,3,,,Smug,"I've been watching {0} this whole time...
Trying not to get noticed... It reminds me of... me..."
t_suspect_r,4,,,Thinking,"{0} seems... well, fine to me.
But... as for who we should keep an eye on?
I feel like {0} is... kinda suspicious."
t_suspect_r,5,,,Neutral,"{0} is alright. {0} is... alright.
Nope... I wanna believe it... but I just can't."
t_suspect_r,6,,,Smug,"I... I trusted {0}...
But, {0} just...
I just can't anymore..."
t_suspect_r,7,,,,{1} said that {0} was suspicious.
t_suspect_add,0,,,Neutral,"Um, {0} is, uh...
Acting sorta, uh... strange.
I mean, maybe it's just me, but..."
t_suspect_t0,0,,,Hurt,"I... I agree!
I, too, am sort of... spooked by {0}..."
t_suspect_t0,1,,,Annoyed,"It may be... a diversion...
The way {0} is sort of acting... overboard like that..."
t_suspect_t0,2,,,Happy,"I feel a little better now...
Knowing that it isn't only me who's suspicious of {0}."
t_suspect_t0,3,,,Neutral,"With all that's going on, clamming up is kinda... weird, right?"
t_suspect_t0,4,,,Smug,I feel like doubting {0} is sort of... only natural.
t_suspect_t0,5,,,Thinking,"I-I, too, am starting to wonder about {0}..."
t_suspect_t0,6,,,Happy,"OK, good...
It isn't just me who's doubting {0}..."
t_suspect_t1,0,,,Smug,"I agree with {1}...
I don't think {0} is, uh..."
t_suspect_t1,1,,,Thinking,"Yeah... I felt the same way.
There's just... something strange about {0}."
t_suspect_t1,2,,,Smug,"So, we should't trust {0}...?
Actually... I think I sort of understand."
t_suspect_t1,3,,,Thinking,"So, staying quiet... looks suspicious, huh?
Yeah... I guess that's just how it goes..."
t_suspect_t1,4,,,Neutral,"I don't think this is, uh... really the time to trust {0}..."
t_suspect_t1,5,,,Thinking,"Actually, now that you mention it...
Yeah, {0} is sort of... suspicious..."
t_suspected0,0,,,Thinking,"R-really...?
I, uh, I'm not really much of a talker, so..."
t_suspected0,1,,,Neutral,"Oh, uh... sorry.
I'm just, sort of... thinking."
t_hanron0,0,,,Happy,"I feel like {0} is alright.
I mean, probably..."
t_hanron0,1,,,Thinking,"{1}... w-why...
Why do you distrust {0} so much?
I... I just don't get it."
t_hanron1,0,,,Neutral,"I, um...
I actually... don't think {0} is that suspicious, myself..."

I wanna trust {0}, too."

I trust {0}."

I want to trust {0} after all..."
t_trust,2,,,Happy,{0}... I-... I'm counting on you.
t_trust_r,0,,,Hurt,"I, uh...!
I hate seeing {0} be distrusted like this...!
I just can't abide!"
t_trust_r,1,,,Neutral,"Hey, um... I gave it a lot of thought.
And... I want to try trusting {0} for a change."
t_trust_r,2,,,Thinking,"{0}... I believe you.
So, you know... Please don't betray my trust, OK?"
t_trust_t0,0,,,Happy,"Yeah, I think {0} is OK..."
t_trust_t1,0,,,Happy,"{1}, do you... do you really think so?
Well then, I trust {0}, too."
t_trusted0,0,,,Happy,So... you really trust me...
t_thanron0,0,,,Thinking,"But can we... can we really trust {0}...?
I, uh... I just can't do it..."
t_thanron1,0,,,Neutral,"I want to be more trusting, I really do...
But watching {0}, I... I just can't..."
t_thanron_t0,0,,,Neutral,"I-I...
I just can't say with confidence that {0} is OK..."
t_thanron_t1,0,,,Smug,"I'm just...
Too scared to trust {0}."
t_hosho,0,,,Happy,"If {0} is {1}...
Yeah, it has to be so."
t_hosho,1,,,Thinking,"{0} is definitely human...
Yeah... No doubt about it."
t_hosho_enemy,0,,,Annoyed,"{0}, you're not the {1}. You couldn't be!
Just... what are you even thinking?"
t_hosho_enemy,1,,,Surprised,{0}... {0} is... {1}!
t_hosho_enemy,2,,,Thinking,"{0} is {1}...
As much as I don't want to believe it, it's true..."
t_hosho_enemy,3,,,Surprised,"What, huh?! Just what is it with you?!
{0}, why were you brought into this world?!"
t_hosho_enemy,4,,,Hurt,"Um, hey! The data, uh...
{0}'s data doesn't make sense!
So something is definitely fishy with {0}!"
t_hosho_enemy,5,,,Thinking,"{0} is not Gnosia. But...
{0} is also not... on the side of us humans.
So, why...?"
t_hosho_miss,0,,,Hurt,"I'm sorry!
{0}, that's... that's just wrong."
t_hosho_miss,1,,,Annoyed,"{0}... why?
Why repeat something we already know?
Something is... off."
t_hosho_get,0,,,Happy,"OK... I feel a bit more at ease now.
It's true, I'm... the {1}."
t_hosho_get,1,,,Annoyed,I... I have nothing more to say.
t_tohyo_go,0,,,Smug,"So... nobody has anything to say...?
Well... neither do I..."
t_tohyo_mae,0,,,Smug,"So it's time... Time to vote.
We have to decide who to send off to cold sleep."
t_tohyo_sai,0,,,Neutral,So... we have to decide from among the people who tied...
t_shokei,0,,,Annoyed,"So... you choose me, I see.
Alright... I'm off to cold sleep."
t_shokei,1,,,Smug,"It's only natural that you'd choose me...
But, why...?
Why did things have to be like this...?"
t_wakare,0,,,Surprised,{0}... I-I...!
t_karare,0,,,Surprised,"{0}...?!
But... why...?!
Is... is this where it all ends for me...?!"
t_imjinro,0,,,Gnosia,"So... nobody noticed me, I see.
I... I am... {0}!"
t_shori,0,,,Happy,"So... we got rid of the {0}...?
I'm so lucky... to have been on this ship with all of you..."
t_tohyo_kurikaeshi,0,,,Annoyed,I guess... a simple vote just won't work...
t_tohyo_jeno,0,,,Thinking,"Well, I guess... why don't we just freeze all of them...?"
t_tohyo_alive,0,,,Thinking,"I've thought about it...
Can we just... not make ANY decision this time...?"
t_tohyo_jeno_ok,0,,,Neutral,Yeah... I think that's our only real option this time...
t_tohyo_jeno_ng,0,,,Neutral,I don't know... I don't think that's a good idea...
t_tohyo_alive_ok,0,,,Happy,I think that's a good idea... yeah.
t_tohyo_alive_ng,0,,,Thinking,"I just... can't agree.
I'm sorry..."
t_tohyo_jeno_kettei,0,,,Hurt,"I'm sorry...!
It looks like it's cold sleep after all...
P-please, get prepared..."
t_tohyo_alive_kettei,0,,,Happy,"So... it's decided, then.
Or rather, nothing was decided...
Alright then, see you all tomorrow..."
t_tohyo_hitei,0,,,Annoyed,"So it's... not going to work, then?
I... No, nothing. Never mind..."
t_tohyo_dame,0,,,Smug,"It looks like we're out of time...
I'm going back to my room... before night falls."
t_tohyo_dame,1,,,,...
t_co,0,,,,dammy
t_co,1,,,Happy,"If I focus the ship's dimensional vibration sensors...
I can detect the Gnosia's specific dimensional waves...
Oh, I, uh... I'm the {0}, by the way."
t_co,2,,,Smug,"I'll examine those put into cold sleep.
I'm the {0}, so..."
t_co,3,,,Happy,"I hadn't said anything, but I'm actually a {0}."

t_co_after,2,,,Hurt,"But there's only supposed to be... one {0}!
Something's wrong here..."

t_uranai_s,0,,,,"I checked the dimensional waves...
"
t_uranai_b,0,,,,"I... checked on someone else.
"
t_uranai_t,0,,,Surprised,{1}... {1} is {0}!

Why... why did I think such things...?
I... I don't even understand it myself..."
t_personal,11,0,,Smug,"With the Gnosia on the ship...
We had a lot of... hard times, but..."
t_personal,11,1,,Happy,"Some... good things also came of it... 
Getting to meet someone like you, {0}...
I'm thankful for that..."
t_personal,12,0,,Neutral,"Being done in by the Gnosia...
Or continuing to live on..."
t_personal,12,1,,Smug,I wonder which is more painful...?
t_personal,13,0,,Smug,"Oh...
So... we won...?"
t_personal,14,0,,Smug,"So... I guess we won after all...
It's... somehow strange.
It feels... unreal."
