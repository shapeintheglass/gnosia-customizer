I wonder why that happens...?"

I'd like to hear from other people, too."
t_suspect,2,,,Annoyed,"So, everyone seems to trust {0}... but...
That feels, um... sort of weird..."
t_suspect,3,,,Thinking,"So, uh... I've been thinking...
I wonder why {0} doesn't seem to, uh... speak up...?"

t_suspect_t1,2,,,Annoyed,"Hm... Now that I think about it, I sort of agree..."
t_suspect_t1,3,,,Smug,"{0}, I think you should speak up a little more.
Then, nobody would think you're, uh, you know... ""{0} is kinda weird""..."

What exactly is wrong with... {0}?
Not feeling well, or maybe {1}...?"

It's strange... So many things are strange..."
t_tohyo_kurikaeshi,0,,,Thinking,"Once again, it didn't work out... What do we do?"
t_tohyo_jeno,0,,,Neutral,"{0}.
For cold sleep, I mean.
I think it's better than being killed..."
t_tohyo_alive,0,,,Neutral,"Well, how about nobody goes into cold sleep...?"
t_tohyo_jeno_ok,0,,,Smug,"I recommend cold sleep.
It's chilly and comfortable."
t_tohyo_jeno_ng,0,,,Hurt,"So everyone will be gone...
I'm a little scared..."
t_tohyo_alive_ok,0,,,Smug,I agree with skipping cold sleep.
t_tohyo_alive_ng,0,,,Hurt,"So nobody goes off to cold sleep...?
I think that's dangerous."

I may be able to help find the Gnosia."

So I can examine people in cold sleep.
I can tell if they're Gnosia or not."
t_co,3,,,Happy,"I'm a {0}.
I hope to be able to protect everyone..."
t_co,4,,,Happy,"So, you become Gnosia when you get shocked, right...?

So two people disappeared...
Was one of them... a bug...?"

That's... kind of creepy to me..."
t_skill_zatsudan,6,,,Hurt,"Um, {0}...
I feel like, maybe, right now...
We should be talking about the Gnosia..."
t_skill_roller,0,,,Thinking,"So, there's only one real {0}, right?
Something's wrong, so we should send everyone to cold sleep..."
t_skill_roller,1,,,Thinking,"Vote for everyone who claimed to be the {0}? But...
Um, OK... It looks like that's the way to go."
t_skill_roller,2,,,Annoyed,"Everyone who claimed to be the {0}, they'll be gone...
I don't like that..."

I want the {0} to stay with us..."
t_skill_roller,4,,,Happy,"I'm happy someone agrees.
They will probably get more votes, but...
I just hope this works out for us..."
t_skill_roller,5,,,Thinking,"Um, I just thought it might help...
It's not that everyone has to vote for them.
Please, just forget about it..."
t_skill_roller,6,,,Thinking,"Um, so, there's only one real {0}, so...
Maybe we should put everyone claiming to be {0} in cold sleep."

I don't think {0} should be put into cold sleep tonight."
t_skill_dontTohyo,1,,,Happy,"Yeah, I agree.
I don't think we should vote for {0}, either."
t_skill_dontTohyo,2,,,Hurt,"I, um...
I don't think we should decide not to vote for {0}..."
t_skill_dontTohyo,3,,,Thinking,"I agree.
I don't think we should stop from voting for whom they want."

But I'd like to try and get along."
t_personal,0,3,,Smug,"{0}, so you weren't Gnosia after all.
*Squeak!* Neither am I!"

Wow, OK, I'll do my best!"
t_personal,1,0,,Thinking,"Um... {0}...
I, uh... I've realized something..."

Hm... *SQUEAK*"
t_personal,2,0,,Thinking,"{1} seemed kind of, off...
I hope this is OK..."

All the Gnosia are our dear friends, so..."

Actually, I, uh..."
t_personal,17,2,,Gnosia,"I'm Gnosia!
Hehehe... I can finally get that off my chest!"
t_personal,18,0,,Annoyed,"Um... {0}...
I'm actually a Bug."
t_personal,18,1,,Hurt,"But I felt like I had to try my best to survive.
It may not work out, but I wanted to live."
