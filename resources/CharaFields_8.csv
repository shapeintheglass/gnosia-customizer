C'mon, I can't talk about that in front of everyone!"
t_skill_zatsudan,5,,,Neutral,"A scary story from back home? How about the armbug?

t_personal,0,0,,Happy,"Welp, I guess you got me.
Now that it's out there, I feel kinda relieved."
t_personal,0,1,,Annoyed,"Hey! Why're you acting all weird?
I already know it's you, so just calm down."
t_personal,0,2,,Smug,"Hm... I know that {0} is lying.
Now, if only everyone would trust me on this..."
t_personal,0,3,,Happy,"OK, so... {0} is the real deal, right?
OK OK. So am I, so remember that, alright?"
t_personal,0,4,,Surprised,"Hey, it's {0}.
Wait a sec... {0}, you're the real thing, right...?
Heh, sorry, I almost forgot."
t_personal,0,5,,Happy,"So {0}, you seem pretty real.
If it turns out you're lying, I'll accept the loss."
t_personal,0,6,,Neutral,"I do like you, {0}.
But I gotta separate that from this, you know?"
t_personal,0,7,,Smug,"Oh hey, {0}, what a happenstance.
No wait, was it ""coincidence"", maybe?"
t_personal,0,8,,Smug,"Hey, here comes a sketchy one.
Hehehe, what exactly are you after, hm?"
t_personal,0,9,,Thinking,"Hey {0}, anybody you wanna get rid of?
Me? Yeah, I tend to decide based on who I do or don't like.
So I'll leave it up to you, {0}."
t_personal,0,10,,Neutral,"OK then, let's discuss strategy.
I'll find who the liar is, so {0}, you go on the offensive!"
t_personal,0,11,,Annoyed,"You know, {0}...
I-I'm... Con-con-convert! Convert!"
t_personal,0,12,,Annoyed,"Hey! Why're you acting all weird?
I already know it's you, so just calm down."
t_personal,0,13,,Smug,"Welp, who knows how this is gonna turn out?
So c'mon {0}, let's keep it light, OK?"
t_personal,0,14,,Surprised,"Yeeaah, you should be careful, {0}.
The trap has been set. You're gonna die."
t_personal,0,15,,Happy,"Oh, it's {0}...
Sorry, but I just don't really like you very much."
t_personal,0,16,,Smug,"OK! So, who's the liar, huh?
Watch out, I'm gonna find you!"
t_personal,1,0,,Surprised,"Hey, {0}, listen.
I found the liar!"
t_personal,1,1,,Neutral,"It's {1}.
Definitely a liar... So be careful, OK?"
t_personal,1,2,,Smug,"Hehehe, leave this to me.
Or actually, let's take down {1} together!"
t_personal,2,0,,Neutral,"OK.
That's one down."
t_personal,2,1,,Smug,"Let's keep this streak going.
I'm counting on you, {0}!"
t_personal,3,0,,Surprised,"Oh hey, {0}, perfect timing.
Listen, I got a favor to ask. Well, it's more of a ""plan""."
t_personal,3,1,,Thinking,"You know when I go off on someone for being sketchy?
If I do it alone, I'm worried I'm gonna get taken out.
And then my death would be pointless, you know?"
t_personal,3,2,,Neutral,"So, like...
I wanna team up with someone I can trust.
I mean you, {0}."
t_personal,4,0,,Smug,"OK.
I'll keep going on the offensive.
I'm trusting you to back me up, {0}!"
t_personal,4,1,,Happy,"Hehe...
This is actually kinda nice."
t_personal,5,0,,Hurt,"Oh man, that sucks.
You know, {0}, I really thought you'd help me out."
t_personal,5,1,,Neutral,"Oh well, it's cool.
OK then, see you tomorrow!"
t_personal,6,0,,Surprised,"Hm? What's up, {0}?"
t_personal,6,1,,Thinking,"Who should we take out tonight, huh?
Hm... Let's just do {1}, I guess."
t_personal,6,2,,Neutral,"I mean, we're gonna kill everyone anyway.
Worrying about who goes sooner or later is just a waste of time."
t_personal,7,0,,Surprised,"(Hey, it's a bit late for this, but...
Was getting rid of {1} maybe a mistake?)"
t_personal,7,1,,Happy,"(Sorry if I made things more difficult.
Hehe, I'll apologize now while I still can.)"
t_personal,8,0,,Smug,"Hey, we won!
Hehe, awesome!"
t_personal,8,1,,Neutral,"Thanks, {0}.
It's nice to be able to rely on someone!"
t_personal,9,0,,Neutral,"Looks like the Gnosia's all gone!
So, I guess that means we win, right?"
t_personal,10,0,,Surprised,"Wow, what a surprise.
So {0}, you weren't lying after all, huh?"
t_personal,10,1,,Happy,"Sorry about that.
Oh well, we won in the end, so whatever!"
t_personal,11,0,,Neutral,"You know, that was kinda fun.
{0} and me together, it's kinda nice."
t_personal,11,1,,Smug,"OK, let's hang out again sometime, {0}!
For sure!"
t_personal,12,0,,Thinking,"With Gnosia, and people disappearing and everything...
Space is like, a super weird place, you know?"
t_personal,12,1,,Smug,"I guess you never know what's gonna happen, huh?
That's the fun part of life!"
t_personal,13,0,,Neutral,"Alright, we totally won.
It all worked out somehow."
t_personal,14,0,,Happy,"Wow, that was easy.
I mean, I didn't even really do anything."
t_personal,15,0,,Smug,"OK, so, where to next?
{0} and me together... We can take down anyone!"
t_personal,16,0,,Surprised,"You know, {0}, you're an awesome liar.
I'm like, complimenting you, you know!"
t_personal,16,1,,Neutral,"Anyone ever tell you you'd make a good criminal?
That's a compliment, of course."
t_personal,17,0,,Happy,"Wow, it's finally over.
What a relief."
t_personal,17,1,,Gnosia,"OK, let's go crazy.
Maybe I'll start with {0}!"
t_personal,18,0,,Surprised,"Hm, so it's over.
OK, so I guess I destroy the universe now, huh?"
t_personal,18,1,,Happy,"I mean, I'm a Bug, so, you know.
Hehe... Don't stare at me like that!
I'm gonna blush!"
t_personal,19,0,,Surprised,"Wow, {0}, you're really something.
Fooling everyone and helping us Gnosia win like that!"
t_personal,19,1,,Happy,"So yeah, thanks.
You know, {0}, without you, I would've been screwed.
I would've been shot out into space or something, for sure!"
