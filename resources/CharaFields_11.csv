t_aisatu,0,,,Neutral,"I'm {0}. Friend or foe, we're in this together.
Our fates are intertwined."
t_suspect,0,,,Thinking,"A proposal... Let's remove {0}.
Even if {0} is on our side, I feel it's too dangerous."
t_suspect,1,,,Neutral,"{0}, don't speak up so much.
I want to avoid biased information."
t_suspect,2,,,Thinking,"We've been blindly accepting {0}'s opinions.
Can we really trust {0}...? Let's reassess this, carefully."
t_suspect,3,,,Annoyed,"I'm warning you, {0}.
Staying quiet like that will only benefit the enemy."
t_suspect,4,,,Thinking,"If I had to doubt someone...
Stochastically, I feel it should be {0}."
t_suspect,5,,,Annoyed,"I don't care if you lie, {0}.
But what's the purpose of these lies?"
t_suspect,6,,,Smug,"Listen, {0}...
I can't help you anymore.
It may endanger everyone."
t_suspect,7,,,Thinking,"This time, {1} was eliminated...
And {1} was at odds with... you, {0}.
More than enough reason to doubt you."
t_suspect_r,0,,,Neutral,"{0} is... dangerous, for certain.
We'd do best to assume they're the enemy."
t_suspect_r,1,,,Thinking,"Be careful, {0}.
Attract too much attention, and you may be targeted next."
t_suspect_r,2,,,Neutral,"We seem to believe that {0} is on our side.
Or rather, we were tricked into believing so?"
t_suspect_r,3,,,Neutral,"{0}, it's not good to keep quiet like that.
You have to prove that you're worth our trust."
t_suspect_r,4,,,Thinking,"There is a significant chance that {0} is our enemy.
We can't forget that."
t_suspect_r,5,,,Hurt,"{0}, I thought you were on our side, but...
Apparently, I was wrong..."
t_suspect_r,6,,,Smug,"Listen, {0}...
I can't help you anymore.
It may endanger everyone."
t_suspect_r,7,,,,"{0} is suspicious, according to {1}."
t_suspect_add,0,,,Neutral,"We still don't know who our enemy is...
But I've chosen not to trust {0}.
Maybe this will help me to find something out."
t_suspect_t0,0,,,Annoyed,"If you're going up against {0}, then I'll cooperate."
t_suspect_t0,1,,,Thinking,"I see...
{0} may be trying to hinder the exchange of information."
t_suspect_t0,2,,,Thinking,"{0} is...
Well, I feel there's sufficient reason to be wary."
t_suspect_t0,3,,,Neutral,OK. We need to keep an eye on {0}.
t_suspect_t0,4,,,Neutral,Yes. I feel we should be suspicious of {0}.
t_suspect_t0,5,,,Neutral,"So you want to get rid of {0} ASAP, huh?
I think I agree."
t_suspect_t0,6,,,Neutral,"Of course I'm in.
To me at least, {0} is definitely the enemy here."
t_suspect_t1,0,,,Thinking,I can't agree with that... But I'll cooperate.
t_suspect_t1,1,,,Neutral,"{0}, the enemy is likely paying close attention to you now.
Move with caution, {0}."
t_suspect_t1,2,,,Surprised,{0}? The enemy? But...
t_suspect_t1,3,,,Neutral,"We need information, {0}.
Help us out... if you're really on our side."
t_suspect_t1,4,,,Thinking,I guess we can't overlook the potential risk of having {0} around...
t_suspect_t1,5,,,Thinking,I think {0} may be the enemy after all...
t_suspected0,0,,,Thinking,"So, I guess I'm in the way, huh?"
t_suspected0,1,,,Neutral,"Let's calm down and talk this through, everyone...
Get too emotional, and the enemy's got us."
t_hanron0,0,,,Annoyed,"I've got {0}'s back.
If you're gonna go after {0}, then I'm gonna push back."
t_hanron0,1,,,Annoyed,"{1}, what is it you're after? Are you trying to split us up?
I can't let you do that."
t_hanron1,0,,,Neutral,"No, we can't eliminate {0} now.
We should see how things play out."
t_hanron_t0,0,,,Thinking,I don't want {0} to go away just now...
t_hanron_t1,0,,,Thinking,"I'm conflicted...
I feel that {0} could be on our side."
t_trust,0,,,Smug,"I've got {0}'s back.
Even if... No... Just because I want to."
t_trust,1,,,Thinking,"Yeah, I want to trust {0}.
My reasons? Probability, and... a hunch, I guess?"
t_trust,2,,,Neutral,"{0} is on our side.
Even if nobody else agrees, I think so."
t_trust_r,0,,,Smug,"Well, personally...
I don't want {0} to go away..."
t_trust_r,1,,,Neutral,"A proposal...
Chances of {0} being on our side are somewhat high.
Why don't we go ahead and assume that's the case?"
t_trust_r,2,,,Neutral,"Now, this is just my personal opinion.
But I just can't see {0} as an enemy."
t_trust_t0,0,,,Thinking,"{0}? Yeah...
Seems trustworthy to me."
t_trust_t1,0,,,Neutral,"If we assume that {0} is on our side, then...
OK, I agree."
t_trusted0,0,,,Happy,Thank you. I'll try not to let you down...
t_thanron0,0,,,Annoyed,"I disagree.
If {0} ends up being our enemy, the damage would be irreparable."
t_thanron1,0,,,Neutral,"I get that you want to believe, but think this through calmly.
One person here is guaranteed to be our enemy."
t_thanron_t0,0,,,Hurt,"I agree. This isn't good. I'm afraid that...
Now is not the time to be trusting {0}."
t_thanron_t1,0,,,Hurt,"Sorry, {0}.
I just... can't trust you."
t_hosho,0,,,Neutral,"Thank you for the info.
Now it's clear that {0} is {1}."
t_hosho,1,,,Neutral,"With the info we have, it's clear that {0} is human.
They pose no threat."
t_hosho_enemy,0,,,Annoyed,"Now we're clear.
{0} is definitely not {1}."
t_hosho_enemy,1,,,Annoyed,"It's too late. The truth has come out.
{0} is... {1}!"
t_hosho_enemy,2,,,Hurt,"{0} is {1}. This is a fact.
However unfortunate it may be..."
t_hosho_enemy,3,,,Thinking,"Looking at the info we have... {0} is {1}.
This is extremely dangerous."
t_hosho_enemy,4,,,Thinking,"This makes no sense... {0}'s statements are contradicting.
So that means that {0} is lying... right?"
t_hosho_enemy,5,,,Neutral,"Two things are clear here.
1 - {0} couldn't possibly be Gnosia.
2 - {0}'s statements don't add up."
t_hosho_miss,0,,,Surprised,"No, {0}... You know that's not true."
t_hosho_miss,1,,,Surprised,"Come on, {0}...
Everyone knows this already."
t_hosho_get,0,,,Neutral,"Thank you, {0}.
We need info to flush out the enemy. Let's get this done."
t_hosho_get,1,,,Smug,"I can't talk my way out of this one...
Hah... I keep messing up."
t_tohyo_go,0,,,Neutral,"If nobody objects, let's start the vote...
Speak now, or forever hold your peace."
t_tohyo_mae,0,,,Thinking,"This is how we do battle...
Let's start the vote. We have to eradicate the enemy."
t_tohyo_sai,0,,,Hurt,"Yeah, this isn't an easy decision.
Everyone has their own motives."
t_shokei,0,,,Happy,"I guess... this is it.
I'll take my leave. See you all again."
t_shokei,1,,,Hurt,"Yes, I understand your decision.
Sorry, and good luck."
t_wakare,0,,,Happy,"Bye-bye, {0}. See you again."
t_karare,0,,,Surprised,"{0}! I...
I won't give up. I... refuse to give up!"
t_imjinro,0,,,Gnosia,"Looking into your eyes like this, {0}...
I can see that the universe has always been perverted."
t_shori,0,,,Thinking,"The {0} is gone, and I'm still alive.
Did I win? But, I...
I want to become stronger still..."
t_tohyo_kurikaeshi,0,,,Neutral,"The results will always be the same.
Let's think of a way to get through this."
t_tohyo_jeno,0,,,Happy,"{0}, you should rest.
Leave the rest of this battle to us."
t_tohyo_alive,0,,,Thinking,"Now, we wait... quietly. For the enemy's next move."
t_tohyo_jeno_ok,0,,,Neutral,Put all of the candidates into cold sleep? I agree.
t_tohyo_jeno_ng,0,,,Thinking,"Who wants to see the candidates gone?
Not me... So I'm against it."
t_tohyo_alive_ok,0,,,Neutral,"So, we don't make a move. No cold sleep.
You know... That's not bad. I agree."
t_tohyo_alive_ng,0,,,Thinking,I can't agree with this.
t_tohyo_jeno_kettei,0,,,Happy,"Alright, {0}.
Goodbye for now... See you again."
t_tohyo_alive_kettei,0,,,Annoyed,"And tomorrow, someone else... will disappear.
That's the choice we made.
Can you all live with that?"
t_tohyo_hitei,0,,,Hurt,I... I still need to be stronger.
t_tohyo_dame,0,,,Neutral,"No more talk... The enemy is about to move.
Let's all pair up and go back to our rooms."
t_tohyo_dame,1,,,,...
t_co,0,,,,...
t_co,1,,,Neutral,"I'll share all the info I can gather as {0}.
Use it to work out who our enemy is."
t_co,2,,,Neutral,"Speaking as {0}...
It's difficult to tell who has become Gnosia.
But I can tell by examining a subject in cold sleep."
t_co,3,,,Thinking,"I'm a {0}, and can protect against any enemy attack.
But even so, deciding whom to protect...
That's the difficult part."
t_co,4,,,Neutral,"The first attack occurred at the last port, outside the ship.
According to the log, this is a fact...
Having remained on the ship, I'm not Gnosia. This is also a fact."
t_co,5,,,,dammy
t_co,6,,,,dammy
t_co,7,,,,dammy
t_co,8,,,,dammy
t_co_find,0,,,,dammy
t_co_find,1,,,Annoyed,"I can't just stay quiet...
{1} is Gnosia according to the results of my research as {0}."
t_co_find,2,,,Neutral,"There are two pieces of info I can share. One is that I'm the {0}...
The other is that according to my examination, {1} was Gnosia."
t_co_find,3,,,,dammy
t_co_find,4,,,,dammy

t_co_find,7,,,,dammy
t_co_find,8,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,0,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,1,,,Annoyed,"That was quick.
{1} is an enemy.
To me, the only {0} here, at least."
t_co_taiko,2,,,Annoyed,"Objection. The {0} is me, not {1}.
Our enemy is trying to confuse us with lies.
I can't let that happen."
t_co_taiko,3,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,4,,,Neutral,"Yes, {1} is not Gnosia.
{1} and I remained on the ship, and can vouch for each other.
Any objections?"
t_co_taiko,5,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,6,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,7,,,,dammy
t_co_taiko,8,,,,dammy
t_co_req,0,,,Neutral,"A proposal...
Anyone with {0} credentials, speak up."
t_co_after,0,,,Neutral,"I guess nobody else wants to come forward...
In that case, only {1} could possibly be {0}.
Am I mistaken?"
t_co_after,1,,,Thinking,"Between {1}, one of them is our enemy...
That, and whoever DIDN'T claim the role is not the {0}.
These two points are clear."
t_co_after,2,,,Thinking,"Among {1}, we have at most one ally.
That, and whoever DIDN'T claim the role couldn't be the {0}.
We should consider these two points to be fact."
t_uranai_o,0,,,Hurt,I have some information...
t_uranai_s,0,,,,"As Engineer, I have some info to present.
"
t_uranai_b,0,,,,"Next, allow me to present some information.
"
t_uranai_t,0,,,Annoyed,{1} is definitely {0}.
t_uranai_f,0,,,Thinking,"If nothing else, {1} was not {0}."
t_uranai_n,0,,,Hurt,"As Engineer, I have nothing in particular to report.
There is no one left requiring investigation."
t_reibai_s,0,,,,"Here are the results of my post-cold sleep tests from last night.
"
t_reibai_s,1,,,,...
t_reibai_t,0,,,Thinking,{1} {3} {0}.
t_reibai_f,0,,,Neutral,"If nothing else, {1} {3} not {0}."
t_reibai_ft,0,,,Thinking,{2} {4} {0}.
t_reibai_ff,0,,,Thinking,"Zero. {1}...
Nobody was {0}."
t_houkoku_s,0,,,Neutral,My results were the same.
t_houkoku_w,0,,,Annoyed,Apparently there are some discrepancies. Here are my results.
t_okuyami,0,,,Hurt,"{0}...
I guess... I failed again..."
t_okuyami_n,0,,,Happy,"Yes... That's right!
Zero victims. Please, let this keep going..."
t_okuyami_f,0,,,Thinking,"{0}. One of them... was a bug.
According to Engineer reports, they fell victim to their own contradictions..."
t_houkoku_req,0,,,Neutral,Nothing else to report?
t_houkoku_not,0,,,Neutral,"{0}... How about your report?
Our lives depend on information. Be careful."
t_skill_sayNingen,0,,,Neutral,"A proposal...
Could everyone state that you're human, one at a time?"
t_skill_sayNingen,1,,,Neutral,"I'm human.
OK, who's next?"
t_skill_sayNingen,2,,,Thinking,"Hey, {0}.
It's dangerous to spook the enemy. Let's not do this."
t_skill_sayNingen,3,,,Hurt,"So, nobody, then...?
I guess everyone's being cautious, friend and foe alike."
t_skill_sayNingen,4,,,Thinking,"Thanks for your cooperation...
Those of you who didn't comply, you're under suspicion...
But you realize that."
t_skill_sayNingen,5,,,Thinking,"Thanks, everyone...
The more intuitive of us should be able to see clearly...
Who is on our side, and who is against us."
t_skill_sayNingen,6,,,Annoyed,"All you had to say was that you're human...
There should be no reason to stop everyone.
I mean, if you really are on our side, {0}."
t_skill_zatsudan,0,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,1,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,2,,,,...
t_skill_zatsudan,3,,,Neutral,"Oh yeah, I've got some rations - want some?
They're military rations, so I can't promise they'll be tasty."
t_skill_zatsudan,4,,,Smug,"I don't have any romance stories to tell.
But the feeling of wanting to open your heart to someone... I get that."
t_skill_zatsudan,5,,,Smug,"Ghost stories, huh? Hehe...
This whole situation is basically a ghost story.
Sorry, that was stupid. Forget I said it."
t_skill_zatsudan,6,,,Hurt,"Sorry... but we don't have time for that right now.
Let's talk about finding our enemy."
t_skill_roller,0,,,Thinking,"All those who claimed to be the {0}... Let's put all of them into cold sleep.
That way we can definitely reduce the number of our enemies.
Of course... there will be sacrifices made, too."
t_skill_roller,1,,,Neutral,"So prioritizing the vote for those who say they are the {0}, huh...
Yeah, I think it could be effective in dealing damage to our enemy."
t_skill_roller,2,,,Neutral,"No, we shouldn't thoughtlessly narrow down our voting choices like that.
Who voted against whom could be an important piece of information."
t_skill_roller,3,,,Thinking,I don't agree with this. Considering our situation and all.
t_skill_roller,4,,,Thinking,"Now, a number of votes will go to them, including mine...
With that in mind, I want you all to think once again...
Who should you really be voting against?"
t_skill_roller,5,,,Hurt,"Yes... I realize that this is a somewhat heartless way of doing this.
But I feel it's necessary for our survival.
Please keep this in mind when considering how you'll vote."
t_skill_roller,6,,,Thinking,"Unfortunately, those who say they are the {0}... are our enemy.
They should all be put into cold sleep."
t_skill_doTohyo,0,,,Neutral,"A proposal...
{1} has reported that {0} is Gnosia.
So why don't we vote against {0} this time?"
t_skill_doTohyo,1,,,Thinking,"According to my research, {0} has definitely become Gnosia.
Therefore, I'd have to say that we should vote against {0}...
But I'll leave it up to all of you to decide for yourselves."
t_skill_doTohyo,2,,,,"Looks like we're all clear this time.
Let's vote... Against our enemy, {0}."
t_skill_doTohyo,3,,,Hurt,"That's not gonna work, {1}...
There have been no reports that {0} is Gnosia."
t_skill_doTohyo,4,,,Neutral,"I agree.
I think we should vote for {0}."
t_skill_doTohyo,5,,,Annoyed,"Think about this before coming to any conclusions...
Who specifically would benefit from gathering support against me...?"
t_skill_doTohyo,6,,,Hurt,"I can't agree with that.
It's dangerous to narrow our choices down too far.
The enemy could be behind this."
t_skill_doTohyo,7,,,Thinking,"Yeah. I can't get behind {1}'s proposal, either."
t_skill_dontTohyo,0,,,Neutral,"Yeah... We should remove {0} from the list of candidates.
There are more dangerous people in this group."
t_skill_dontTohyo,1,,,Thinking,"Just as {1} says.
{0} isn't the one we need to be fighting against right now."
t_skill_dontTohyo,2,,,Neutral,"I actually disagree with that.
I think we should leave the option to vote against {0} open."
t_skill_dontTohyo,3,,,Thinking,"Well.
Let's let everyone decide whether or not to vote against {0}."
t_skill_kyoryoku,0,,,,...
t_skill_kyoryoku,1,,,Neutral,"Yes, let's help each other out. But...
One of us may end up betraying the other depending on what happens.
We need to be ready for that, should it come down to it."
t_skill_kyoryoku,2,,,Thinking,"Sorry, but... I can't just trust you unconditionally.
Can you give me some time to think about it?"
t_skill_t_doui,0,,,Neutral,"Yeah, I agree with {0}.
If you all trust my judgment, I'd like to ask you to trust {0}, alright?"
t_skill_t_hanronKinshi,0,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,0,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,1,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,2,,,,...
t_skill_t_kyakushoku,3,,,,...
t_skill_h_uyamuya,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_hangeki,0,,,Annoyed,"I'm going to have to object, {0}.
To me, the one we need to be suspicious of is you, {0}."
t_skill_h_dojo,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,0,,,,...
t_skill_h_help,1,,,Neutral,"Sorry...
I can't help you out considering the situation we're in, {0}."
t_skill_h_careful,0,,,,...
t_skill_dogeza,0,,,Hurt,"Stop, {0}.
Have you no shame?"
t_skill_dogeza,1,,,,...
t_personal,0,0,,Smug,"{0}...
Hehe, it looks like this is it for me. Sorry, but I'm leaving the rest up to you."
t_personal,0,1,,Smug,"Don't worry about it too much, {0}.
Even I have made plenty of mistakes before.
Too many to count, really..."
t_personal,0,2,,Happy,"This time, you and I are enemies, {0}.
Hehe, don't bother holding back, OK?"
t_personal,0,3,,Thinking,"{0}, you and I are both definitely human, right?
This makes us more easily targeted by the Gnosia.
I pray for good luck... for both of us."
t_personal,0,4,,Neutral,"I don't think anyone has anymore reason to doubt you, {0}.
Now, we just have to pay close attention to the situation...
And try not to stand out too much and become an easy target."
t_personal,0,5,,Smug,"{0}, I trust you... I mean...
Even if you turn out to be the enemy, don't feel too bad about it, OK?
We both have to look out for Number One, after all."
t_personal,0,6,,Happy,"{0}... Are you really even on our side?
Hehe, just kidding. You don't need to answer that."
t_personal,0,7,,Neutral,"Hey, {0}. Find anything out?
Perfect timing, care for a little chat?"
t_personal,0,8,,Happy,"At this point, {0}, I'm not 100% sure you're on my side, but...
I'm glad you came."
t_personal,0,9,,Neutral,"Seeing things from the Gnosia point of view like this...
It may help us to solve this mystery.
So I want you to try experimenting a bit, {0}."
t_personal,0,10,,Happy,"Teaming up with {0}... Hehe.
Sorry, this is starting to get sort of fun, you know?
But don't worry, I'm taking it seriously."
t_personal,0,11,,Thinking,"It's... a shell. The voice pipe of thought is guilty.
Is this... love?"
t_personal,0,12,,Smug,"Don't worry about it too much, {0}.
Even I have made plenty of mistakes before.
Too many to count, really..."
t_personal,0,13,,Happy,"You used your precious free time to come see me?
That's unexpected, but... Hehe. I'm glad you came, {0}."
t_personal,0,14,,Thinking,"I don't think I'm going to be able to work with you this time, {0}.
It's unfortunate, but that's just how it is."
t_personal,0,15,,Smug,"Sorry... My emotions are a bit out of whack.
I want to be left alone for now."
t_personal,0,16,,Neutral,"Alright, let's get started.
We've got to find our enemy."
t_personal,1,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,2,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,3,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,4,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,5,0,,Neutral,
t_personal,6,0,,Thinking,"When you turn out to be Gnosia...
It's difficult to decide whom you must eliminate."
t_personal,6,1,,Hurt,"Simply go for someone with a crucial role, and the Guardian Angel will stop you.
But then again, letting them live can cause you trouble later."
t_personal,6,2,,Neutral,"Yeah, considering the current situation...
I think it would be most effective to go for {1} at the moment..."
t_personal,7,0,,Neutral,"(Just as planned, {1} is gone.)"
t_personal,7,1,,Smug,"(I...
 I wonder how many times I've taken out {1} up till now?
 Hehe, I can't even remember anymore...)"
t_personal,8,0,,Gnosia,"We won this one.
Great work, {0}."
t_personal,8,1,,Smug,"Also, thanks.
Even if it's just this once, working together with you, {0}...
It was really special to me."
t_personal,8,2,,Happy,"{0}, together, we can overcome anything.
Hehe, I really think so."
t_personal,9,0,,Neutral,"We humans have won, fulfilling conditions for completion.
That's it for this loop."
t_personal,10,0,,Annoyed,"This was an unexpected victory...
I thought we'd be on opposite sides this time, {0}."
t_personal,10,1,,Thinking,"I'm sorry if I hurt you at all.
Please forgive me."
t_personal,11,0,,Gnosia,"But, {0}...
You've gotten a lot better at handling yourself in discussion."
t_personal,11,1,,Surprised,"I just hope I don't hold you back, {0}.
Hehe, just joking."
t_personal,11,2,,Thinking,"Huh? That... wasn't funny?
Uh, sorry... I'll try harder."
t_personal,12,0,,Gnosia,"{0}, you and I may not be on the same side next time, but...
In the bigger picture, I'm always right there with you."
t_personal,12,1,,Smug,"Please don't forget that.
I want you to trust me..."
t_personal,13,0,,Neutral,"Good work, {0}.
That's it for now. Another victory for the Gnosia."
t_personal,14,0,,Happy,"We won. And without a single casualty.
Hehe, glad you're on my side, {0}."
t_personal,15,0,,Thinking,"To be honest...
I feel safer when I know you're on my side, {0}."
t_personal,15,1,,Smug,"So this time... Ah, how do I put it...?
I'm... glad it worked out this way."
t_personal,16,0,,Thinking,"I think you're even more cut out for this than I am, {0}.
I guess you're just meant to be Gnosia."
t_personal,16,1,,Surprised,"And I'm not being sarcastic, OK?!
Don't misunderstand!"
t_personal,17,0,,Smug,"Another win for us Gnosia...
Hehe, that's kinda rare, me winning over {0} like this."
t_personal,17,1,,Neutral,"Some info, only Gnosia can find out, or are only found by winning.
That's why I try to win as much as possible."
t_personal,17,2,,Hurt,"But, yeah... I want to hurry up and loop.
As long as I'm infected, I can't get away from this."
t_personal,17,3,,Gnosia,"From this urge to eliminate humans, I mean."
t_personal,18,0,,Thinking,"If we continue to loop like this...
I wonder if the universe can keep going?"
t_personal,18,1,,Hurt,"I... really hope it can.
Because I..."
t_personal,18,2,,Thinking,"I'm a Bug.
I'm going to destroy this universe."
t_personal,19,0,,Happy,"So, a win for us Gnosia, huh...
You're really something, {0}."
t_personal,19,1,,Hurt,"I'm almost never able to survive to the end as an AC Follower.
So to think I'd actually make it to victory..."
t_personal,19,2,,Happy,"Thank you, {0}.
Keep it up."
t_temp,0,,,,"Leads the group with balanced abilities.
Brave and serious, and logic-leaning.
Easily targeted due to low Stealth ability."
